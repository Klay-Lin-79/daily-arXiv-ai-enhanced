### [1] [SILVI: Simple Interface for Labeling Video Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03819)
*Ozan Kanbertay,Richard Vogg,Elif Karakoc,Peter M. Kappeler,Claudia Fichtel,Alexander S. Ecker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SILVI是一个开源标注软件，用于在视频数据中标注动物行为和互动，填补了现有工具在互动检测方面的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开源标注工具要么支持行为标注但不定位个体，要么支持定位但不捕获互动，无法满足理解社交和个体化动物行为的需求。

Method: 开发了SILVI软件，整合了行为标注和个体定位功能，能够在视频数据中直接标注行为和互动。

Result: SILVI能够生成适合训练和验证计算机视觉模型的结构化输出，促进了精细行为分析的自动化方法开发。

Conclusion: SILVI填补了行为生态学与计算机视觉之间的工具空白，不仅适用于动物行为研究，也可用于标注需要提取动态场景图的人类互动视频。

Abstract: Computer vision methods are increasingly used for the automated analysis of
large volumes of video data collected through camera traps, drones, or direct
observations of animals in the wild. While recent advances have focused
primarily on detecting individual actions, much less work has addressed the
detection and annotation of interactions -- a crucial aspect for understanding
social and individualized animal behavior. Existing open-source annotation
tools support either behavioral labeling without localization of individuals,
or localization without the capacity to capture interactions. To bridge this
gap, we present SILVI, an open-source labeling software that integrates both
functionalities. SILVI enables researchers to annotate behaviors and
interactions directly within video data, generating structured outputs suitable
for training and validating computer vision models. By linking behavioral
ecology with computer vision, SILVI facilitates the development of automated
approaches for fine-grained behavioral analyses. Although developed primarily
in the context of animal behavior, SILVI could be useful more broadly to
annotate human interactions in other videos that require extracting dynamic
scene graphs. The software, along with documentation and download instructions,
is available at: https://gitlab.gwdg.de/kanbertay/interaction-labelling-app.

### [2] [Noise Injection: Improving Out-of-Distribution Generalization for Limited Size Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03855)
*Duong Mai,Lawrence Hall*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在训练过程中使用基本噪声注入技术来提高COVID-19胸部X光检测模型的分布外泛化能力，显著减少了ID和OOD评估之间的性能差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在图像识别中往往无法泛化到来自不同设备、人群等的数据，特别是在COVID-19胸部X光检测中，模型会学习利用特定于源的伪影而非合理的生物标志物，导致在分布外数据上表现不佳。

Method: 在训练过程中使用基本噪声注入技术，包括高斯噪声、斑点噪声、泊松噪声和椒盐噪声，以提高模型对分布偏移的鲁棒性。

Result: 实验结果表明，该技术能够显著减少ID和OOD评估之间的性能差距，从0.10-0.20降至0.01-0.06，在AUC、F1、准确率、召回率和特异性等关键指标上均有改善。

Conclusion: 噪声注入技术是一种有效的方法，可以提高COVID-19胸部X光检测模型在分布外数据上的泛化能力，减少模型对特定源伪影的依赖。

Abstract: Deep learned (DL) models for image recognition have been shown to fail to
generalize to data from different devices, populations, etc. COVID-19 detection
from Chest X-rays (CXRs), in particular, has been shown to fail to generalize
to out-of-distribution (OOD) data from new clinical sources not covered in the
training set. This occurs because models learn to exploit shortcuts -
source-specific artifacts that do not translate to new distributions - rather
than reasonable biomarkers to maximize performance on in-distribution (ID)
data. Rendering the models more robust to distribution shifts, our study
investigates the use of fundamental noise injection techniques (Gaussian,
Speckle, Poisson, and Salt and Pepper) during training. Our empirical results
demonstrate that this technique can significantly reduce the performance gap
between ID and OOD evaluation from 0.10-0.20 to 0.01-0.06, based on results
averaged over ten random seeds across key metrics such as AUC, F1, accuracy,
recall and specificity. Our source code is publicly available at

*Florence Klitzner,Blanca Inigo,Benjamin D. Killeen,Lalithkumar Seenivasan,Michelle Song,Axel Krieger,Mathias Unberath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了模仿学习在X射线引导脊柱手术中的应用，开发了模拟环境训练基于视觉的插管对齐策略，在68.5%的案例中首次尝试成功，展示了从仿真到真实X射线的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究模仿学习在X射线引导脊柱手术中的适用性，解决多视图X射线解释的复杂性挑战，探索轻量级、无需CT的机器人术中脊柱导航方案。

Method: 开发高真实度的X射线引导脊柱手术模拟沙盒，构建正确轨迹和双平面X射线序列数据集，训练基于视觉信息的模仿学习策略进行规划和开环控制。

Result: 策略在68.5%案例中首次尝试成功，保持安全的椎弓根内轨迹，能泛化到复杂解剖结构（包括骨折），对多样化初始化保持鲁棒性，在真实X射线上产生合理轨迹。

Conclusion: 虽然初步结果有前景，但入口点精度存在局限，完整闭环控制需要更频繁的反馈机制。结合更强先验和领域知识，该方法可为轻量级无CT机器人脊柱导航奠定基础。

Abstract: Imitation learning-based robot control policies are enjoying renewed interest
in video-based robotics. However, it remains unclear whether this approach
applies to X-ray-guided procedures, such as spine instrumentation. This is
because interpretation of multi-view X-rays is complex. We examine
opportunities and challenges for imitation policy learning in bi-plane-guided
cannula insertion. We develop an in silico sandbox for scalable, automated
simulation of X-ray-guided spine procedures with a high degree of realism. We
curate a dataset of correct trajectories and corresponding bi-planar X-ray
sequences that emulate the stepwise alignment of providers. We then train
imitation learning policies for planning and open-loop control that iteratively
align a cannula solely based on visual information. This precisely controlled
setup offers insights into limitations and capabilities of this method. Our
policy succeeded on the first attempt in 68.5% of cases, maintaining safe
intra-pedicular trajectories across diverse vertebral levels. The policy
generalized to complex anatomy, including fractures, and remained robust to
varied initializations. Rollouts on real bi-planar X-rays further suggest that
the model can produce plausible trajectories, despite training exclusively in
simulation. While these preliminary results are promising, we also identify
limitations, especially in entry point precision. Full closed-look control will
require additional considerations around how to provide sufficiently frequent
feedback. With more robust priors and domain knowledge, such models may provide
a foundation for future efforts toward lightweight and CT-free robotic
intra-operative spinal navigation.

### [4] [Desert Waste Detection and Classification Using Data-Based and Model-Based Enhanced YOLOv12 DL Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03888)
*Abdulmumin Sa'ad,Sulaimon Oyeniyi Adebayo,Abdul Jabbar Siddiqui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于剪枝轻量化YOLOv12的实时目标检测框架，结合自对抗训练和专门数据增强策略，用于沙漠环境中的垃圾检测，在精度和效率方面取得显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球垃圾危机日益严重，传统垃圾收集方法在偏远或恶劣环境（如沙漠）中效率低下且危险。现有计算机视觉研究主要关注城市环境和可回收材料，忽视了有机和危险垃圾以及沙漠等未充分探索的地形。

Method: 基于剪枝轻量化YOLOv12构建实时目标检测框架，集成自对抗训练（SAT）和专门数据增强策略，使用DroneTrashNet数据集进行训练。

Result: 在精度、召回率和平均精度（mAP）方面取得显著改进，同时实现低延迟和紧凑模型尺寸，适合在资源受限的无人机上部署。与最先进的轻量级YOLO变体相比，在准确性和效率方面达到最佳平衡。

Conclusion: 结果验证了结合数据中心和模型中心增强方法在沙漠环境中实现稳健实时垃圾检测的有效性。

Abstract: The global waste crisis is escalating, with solid waste generation expected
to increase by 70% by 2050. Traditional waste collection methods, particularly
in remote or harsh environments like deserts, are labor-intensive, inefficient,
and often hazardous. Recent advances in computer vision and deep learning have
opened the door to automated waste detection systems, yet most research focuses
on urban environments and recyclable materials, overlooking organic and
hazardous waste and underexplored terrains such as deserts. In this work, we
propose an enhanced real-time object detection framework based on a pruned,
lightweight version of YOLOv12 integrated with Self-Adversarial Training (SAT)
and specialized data augmentation strategies. Using the DroneTrashNet dataset,
we demonstrate significant improvements in precision, recall, and mean average
precision (mAP), while achieving low latency and compact model size suitable
for deployment on resource-constrained aerial drones. Benchmarking our model
against state-of-the-art lightweight YOLO variants further highlights its
optimal balance of accuracy and efficiency. Our results validate the
effectiveness of combining data-centric and model-centric enhancements for
robust, real-time waste detection in desert environments.

### [5] [Improving Diagnostic Performance on Small and Imbalanced Datasets Using Class-Based Input Image Composition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03891)
*Hlali Azzeddine,Majid Ben Yakhlef,Soulaiman El Hazzat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于类别的图像合成方法，通过将同类多张图像融合成复合图像来增强训练样本的类内方差和信息密度，显著提高了在小型不平衡数据集上的诊断性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对小型不平衡数据集和低质量输入图像导致深度学习模型假阳性率高的问题，需要一种能够增强训练样本质量和信息密度的方法。

Method: 提出了基于类别的图像合成方法，将同类多张图像融合成3x1布局的复合图像，构建了平衡数据集Co-OCTDL，使用VGG16模型进行对比评估。

Result: 在OCTDL数据集上的实验表明，该方法将准确率提升至99.6%，F1分数达到0.995，AUC为0.9996，显著降低了假预测率。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理类别不平衡和小样本问题，即使在弱数据集上也能产生高质量的预测结果。

Abstract: Small, imbalanced datasets and poor input image quality can lead to high
false predictions rates with deep learning models. This paper introduces
Class-Based Image Composition, an approach that allows us to reformulate
training inputs through a fusion of multiple images of the same class into
combined visual composites, named Composite Input Images (CoImg). That enhances
the intra-class variance and improves the valuable information density per
training sample and increases the ability of the model to distinguish between
subtle disease patterns. Our method was evaluated on the Optical Coherence
Tomography Dataset for Image-Based Deep Learning Methods (OCTDL) (Kulyabin et
al., 2024), which contains 2,064 high-resolution optical coherence tomography
(OCT) scans of the human retina, representing seven distinct diseases with a
significant class imbalance. We constructed a perfectly class-balanced version
of this dataset, named Co-OCTDL, where each scan is resented as a 3x1 layout
composite image. To assess the effectiveness of this new representation, we
conducted a comparative analysis between the original dataset and its variant
using a VGG16 model. A fair comparison was ensured by utilizing the identical
model architecture and hyperparameters for all experiments. The proposed
approach markedly improved diagnostic results.The enhanced Dataset achieved
near-perfect accuracy (99.6%) with F1-score (0.995) and AUC (0.9996), compared
to a baseline model trained on raw dataset. The false prediction rate was also
significantly lower, this demonstrates that the method can producehigh-quality
predictions even for weak datasets affected by class imbalance or small sample
size.

### [6] [Adaptive Temporal Refinement: Continuous Depth Allocation and Distance Regression for Efficient Action Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03943)
*Ibne Farabi Shihab,Sanjeda Akter,Anuj Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出边界距离回归（BDR）和自适应时序精化（ATR）两种互补方法，用于时序动作定位中的边界检测优化。BDR通过有符号距离回归替代分类实现信息理论最优定位，ATR通过连续深度选择自适应分配计算资源，在减少18%计算量的同时提升2.9%性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前时序动作定位方法对所有边界采用统一计算，忽视了不同边界检测难度的显著差异，导致计算效率低下。

Method: 1. 边界距离回归（BDR）：使用有符号距离回归替代分类，实现信息理论最优的边界定位；2. 自适应时序精化（ATR）：通过连续深度选择τ∈[0,1]自适应分配计算资源，支持端到端可微优化。

Result: BDR使边界峰值锐度提升43%，在多种架构上一致提升1.8-3.1% mAP@0.7；ATR在THUMOS14上以162G FLOPs实现56.5% mAP@0.7，相比统一处理的53.6%（198G FLOPs）提升2.9%并减少18%计算量。在短动作上提升达4.2%。

Conclusion: 提出的BDR和ATR方法有效解决了时序动作定位中边界检测的计算效率问题，通过自适应计算分配和距离回归优化，在减少计算成本的同时显著提升性能，特别是在边界异质性高的场景下效果更佳。

Abstract: Temporal action localization requires precise boundary detection; however,
current methods apply uniform computation despite significant variations in
difficulty across boundaries. We present two complementary contributions.
First, Boundary Distance Regression (BDR) provides information-theoretically
optimal localization through signed-distance regression rather than
classification, achieving 43\% sharper boundary peaks. BDR retrofits to
existing methods with approximately 50 lines of code, yielding consistent 1.8
to 3.1\% mAP@0.7 improvements across diverse architectures. Second, Adaptive
Temporal Refinement (ATR) allocates computation via continuous depth selection
$\tau \in [0,1]$, enabling end-to-end differentiable optimization without
reinforcement learning. On THUMOS14, ATR achieves 56.5\% mAP@0.7 at 162G FLOPs,
compared to 53.6\% at 198G for uniform processing, providing a 2.9\%
improvement with 18\% less compute. Gains scale with boundary heterogeneity,
showing 4.2\% improvement on short actions. Training cost is mitigated via
knowledge distillation, with lightweight students retaining 99\% performance at
baseline cost. Results are validated across four benchmarks with rigorous
statistical testing.

### [7] [Improving Multi-View Reconstruction via Texture-Guided Gaussian-Mesh Joint Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03950)
*Zhejia Cai,Puhua Jiang,Shiwei Mao,Hongkun Cao,Ruqi Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一处理几何和外观优化的高斯-网格联合优化框架，通过高斯引导的网格可微渲染同时优化网格几何（顶点位置和面）和顶点颜色，实现高质量3D重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常优先考虑几何精度（多视角立体）或逼真渲染（新视角合成），将几何和外观优化解耦，这阻碍了下游编辑任务。

Method: 通过高斯引导的网格可微渲染，利用输入图像的光度一致性和法线深度图的几何正则化，同时优化网格几何和顶点颜色。

Result: 获得了高质量的3D重建结果，可进一步用于下游编辑任务，如重新照明和形状变形。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了几何和外观的联合优化，为3D编辑、AR/VR和数字内容创建等应用提供了更好的基础。

Abstract: Reconstructing real-world objects from multi-view images is essential for
applications in 3D editing, AR/VR, and digital content creation. Existing
methods typically prioritize either geometric accuracy (Multi-View Stereo) or
photorealistic rendering (Novel View Synthesis), often decoupling geometry and
appearance optimization, which hinders downstream editing tasks. This paper
advocates an unified treatment on geometry and appearance optimization for
seamless Gaussian-mesh joint optimization. More specifically, we propose a
novel framework that simultaneously optimizes mesh geometry (vertex positions
and faces) and vertex colors via Gaussian-guided mesh differentiable rendering,
leveraging photometric consistency from input images and geometric
regularization from normal and depth maps. The obtained high-quality 3D
reconstruction can be further exploit in down-stream editing tasks, such as
relighting and shape deformation. The code will be publicly available upon
acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于线性分数变换参数的轻场相机内参标定方法，通过解耦主镜头和微透镜阵列实现准确标定，包含最小二乘解析解和非线性优化，在物理和仿真数据上验证了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 轻场相机内参标定是3D重建的关键但具有挑战性的前提条件，需要准确解耦主镜头和微透镜阵列的参数。

Method: 提出线性分数变换参数α来解耦主镜头和微透镜阵列，包括基于最小二乘的解析解和非线性优化，同时介绍了从原始图像中检测特征的方法。

Result: 在物理和仿真数据上的实验结果表明该方法性能良好，基于该模型的原始轻场图像仿真速度更快，对数据驱动的深度学习方法至关重要。

Conclusion: 该方法为轻场相机内参标定提供了有效的解决方案，代码可从作者网站获取。

Abstract: Accurate calibration of internal parameters is a crucial yet challenging
prerequisite for 3D reconstruction using light field cameras. In this paper, we
propose a linear fractional transformation(LFT) parameter $\alpha$ to decoupled
the main lens and micro lens array (MLA). The proposed method includes an
analytical solution based on least squares, followed by nonlinear refinement.
The method for detecting features from the raw images is also introduced.
Experimental results on both physical and simulated data have verified the
performance of proposed method. Based on proposed model, the simulation of raw
light field images becomes faster, which is crucial for data-driven deep
learning methods. The corresponding code can be obtained from the author's
website.

### [9] [Room Envelopes: A Synthetic Dataset for Indoor Layout Reconstruction from Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03970)
*Sam Bahrami,Dylan Campbell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Room Envelopes合成数据集，用于训练单目几何估计器预测可见表面和结构布局表面，以理解场景范围和物体形状位置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有场景重建方法只能恢复可见表面，导致不完整重建，忽略了被遮挡的结构元素如墙壁、地板和天花板。这些结构元素通常平面、重复且简单，应该相对容易预测。

Method: 创建Room Envelopes合成数据集，提供RGB图像和两个关联点图：一个捕捉可见表面，另一个捕捉移除家具后的结构布局表面。使用该数据集直接监督前馈单目几何估计器。

Result: 该方法能够同时预测第一可见表面和第一布局表面，从而理解场景的边界范围以及其中物体的形状和位置。

Conclusion: Room Envelopes数据集为场景结构元素重建提供了有效的监督方式，使得单目几何估计器能够理解场景的完整布局和物体信息。

Abstract: Modern scene reconstruction methods are able to accurately recover 3D
surfaces that are visible in one or more images. However, this leads to
incomplete reconstructions, missing all occluded surfaces. While much progress
has been made on reconstructing entire objects given partial observations using
generative models, the structural elements of a scene, like the walls, floors
and ceilings, have received less attention. We argue that these scene elements
should be relatively easy to predict, since they are typically planar,
repetitive and simple, and so less costly approaches may be suitable. In this
work, we present a synthetic dataset -- Room Envelopes -- that facilitates
progress on this task by providing a set of RGB images and two associated
pointmaps for each image: one capturing the visible surface and one capturing
the first surface once fittings and fixtures are removed, that is, the
structural layout. As we show, this enables direct supervision for feed-forward
monocular geometry estimators that predict both the first visible surface and
the first layout surface. This confers an understanding of the scene's extent,
as well as the shape and location of its objects.

### [10] [Simple 3D Pose Features Support Human and Machine Social Scene Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03988)
*Wenshuo Qin,Leyla Isik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究发现人类通过3D视觉姿态信息识别社交互动，而大多数AI视觉模型缺乏这种能力。通过结合姿态和深度估计算法提取3D关节位置，发现这些位置信息在预测人类社交判断方面优于当前AI模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解人类如何从视觉输入中快速提取社交互动信息，以及为什么先进的AI视觉系统在这方面仍然面临挑战。

Method: 结合最先进的姿态和深度估计算法提取视频中人物的3D关节位置，并与AI视觉模型进行比较。开发了一组紧凑的3D社交姿态特征来描述面部的位置和方向。

Result: 3D关节位置在预测人类社交判断方面优于大多数AI视觉模型。简化的3D社交姿态特征与完整关节集具有相同的预测能力，并能显著提升现成AI模型的性能。

Conclusion: 人类社交场景理解依赖于3D姿态的显式表示，可以通过简单的结构化视觉空间基元来支持。

Abstract: Humans can quickly and effortlessly extract a variety of information about
others' social interactions from visual input, ranging from visuospatial cues
like whether two people are facing each other to higher-level information. Yet,
the computations supporting these abilities remain poorly understood, and
social interaction recognition continues to challenge even the most advanced AI
vision systems. Here, we hypothesized that humans rely on 3D visuospatial pose
information to make social interaction judgments, which is absent in most AI
vision models. To test this, we combined state-of-the-art pose and depth
estimation algorithms to extract 3D joint positions of people in short video
clips depicting everyday human actions and compared their ability to predict
human social interaction judgments with current AI vision models. Strikingly,
3D joint positions outperformed most current AI vision models, revealing that
key social information is available in explicit body position but not in the
learned features of most vision models, including even the layer-wise
embeddings of the pose models used to extract joint positions. To uncover the
critical pose features humans use to make social judgments, we derived a
compact set of 3D social pose features describing only the 3D position and
direction of faces in the videos. We found that these minimal descriptors
matched the predictive strength of the full set of 3D joints and significantly
improved the performance of off-the-shelf AI vision models when combined with
their embeddings. Moreover, the degree to which 3D social pose features were
represented in each off-the-shelf AI vision model predicted the model's ability
to match human social judgments. Together, our findings provide strong evidence
that human social scene understanding relies on explicit representations of 3D
pose and can be supported by simple, structured visuospatial primitives.

### [11] [CaRF: Enhancing Multi-View Consistency in Referring 3D Gaussian Splatting Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03992)
*Yuwen Tao,Kanglei Zhou,Xin Tan,Yuan Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CaRF是一个在3D高斯空间中直接操作的全可微分框架，通过引入高斯场相机编码和训练配对视图监督，解决了现有方法在多视图一致性方面的不足，显著提升了3D场景理解的可靠性和视图一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D高斯泼溅分割方法依赖2D渲染伪监督和视图特定特征学习，导致跨视图一致性不足。CaRF旨在直接在3D高斯空间中操作，实现多视图一致性。

Method: CaRF引入高斯场相机编码(GFCE)将相机几何融入高斯文本交互，显式建模视图依赖变化；提出训练配对视图监督(ITPVS)在训练期间对齐校准视图间的每个高斯logits。

Result: 在三个代表性基准测试上，CaRF在Ref LERF、LERF OVS和3D OVS数据集上的mIoU分别比最先进方法平均提升了16.8%、4.3%和2.0%。

Conclusion: 这项工作促进了更可靠和视图一致的3D场景理解，对具身AI、AR/VR交互和自主感知具有潜在益处。

Abstract: Referring 3D Gaussian Splatting Segmentation (R3DGS) aims to interpret
free-form language expressions and localize the corresponding 3D regions in
Gaussian fields. While recent advances have introduced cross-modal alignment
between language and 3D geometry, existing pipelines still struggle with
cross-view consistency due to their reliance on 2D rendered pseudo supervision
and view specific feature learning. In this work, we present Camera Aware
Referring Field (CaRF), a fully differentiable framework that operates directly
in the 3D Gaussian space and achieves multi view consistency. Specifically,
CaRF introduces Gaussian Field Camera Encoding (GFCE), which incorporates
camera geometry into Gaussian text interactions to explicitly model view
dependent variations and enhance geometric reasoning. Building on this, In
Training Paired View Supervision (ITPVS) is proposed to align per Gaussian
logits across calibrated views during training, effectively mitigating single
view overfitting and exposing inter view discrepancies for optimization.
Extensive experiments on three representative benchmarks demonstrate that CaRF
achieves average improvements of 16.8%, 4.3%, and 2.0% in mIoU over state of
the art methods on the Ref LERF, LERF OVS, and 3D OVS datasets, respectively.
Moreover, this work promotes more reliable and view consistent 3D scene
understanding, with potential benefits for embodied AI, AR/VR interaction, and
autonomous perception.

*Yihao Luo,Xianglong He,Chuanyu Pan,Yiwen Chen,Jiaqi Wu,Yangguang Li,Wanli Ouyang,Yuanming Hu,Guang Yang,ChoonHwai Yap*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Faithful Contouring是一种稀疏体素化表示方法，支持2048+分辨率，无需将网格转换为场函数或提取等值面，即可实现接近无损的保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于等值面的体素化表示方法严重依赖水密化或渲染优化，这不可避免地会损害几何保真度。

Method: 提出Faithful Contouring稀疏体素化表示，设计双模式自编码器，支持纹理化、操作和编辑。

Result: 在直接表示方面达到10^-5级别的距离误差；在网格重建方面，Chamfer距离减少93%，F-score提高35%。

Conclusion: Faithful Contouring在3D学习任务的表示和重建方面，在准确性和效率上都超越了现有方法。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient voxelized representations of 3D meshes are the
foundation of 3D reconstruction and generation. However, existing
representations based on iso-surface heavily rely on water-tightening or
rendering optimization, which inevitably compromise geometric fidelity. We
propose Faithful Contouring, a sparse voxelized representation that supports
2048+ resolutions for arbitrary meshes, requiring neither converting meshes to
field functions nor extracting the isosurface during remeshing. It achieves
near-lossless fidelity by preserving sharpness and internal structures, even
for challenging cases with complex geometry and topology. The proposed method
also shows flexibility for texturing, manipulation, and editing. Beyond
representation, we design a dual-mode autoencoder for Faithful Contouring,
enabling scalable and detail-preserving shape reconstruction. Extensive
experiments show that Faithful Contouring surpasses existing methods in
accuracy and efficiency for both representation and reconstruction. For direct
representation, it achieves distance errors at the $10^{-5}$ level; for mesh
reconstruction, it yields a 93\% reduction in Chamfer Distance and a 35\%
improvement in F-score over strong baselines, confirming superior fidelity as a
representation for 3D learning tasks.

### [13] [A Hybrid Deep Learning Model for Robust Biometric Authentication from Low-Frame-Rate PPG Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04037)
*Arfina Rahman,Mahesh Banavar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于PPG信号的轻量级生物认证框架，使用低帧率指尖视频提取PPG信号，通过连续小波变换将一维信号转换为时频图，并开发了CVT-ConvMixer-LSTM混合深度学习模型，在46名受试者上实现了98%的认证准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PPG信号因其非侵入性采集、固有的活体检测能力和适用于低成本可穿戴设备而受到生物认证领域的关注，但信号质量受运动伪影、光照变化和个体生理差异影响，需要稳健的特征提取和分类方法。

Method: 使用CFIHSR数据集（46名受试者，14Hz采样率），对原始PPG信号进行预处理（基线漂移去除、PCA运动伪影抑制、带通滤波、傅里叶重采样、幅度归一化），通过连续小波变换生成时频图，开发CVT-ConvMixer-LSTM混合模型结合空间和时间特征。

Result: 在46名受试者上的实验结果显示认证准确率达到98%，验证了模型对噪声和个体间变异的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 由于效率高、可扩展性强且具有固有活体检测能力，该系统非常适合现实世界的移动和嵌入式生物安全应用。

Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG) signals, which measure changes in blood volume in
the skin using light, have recently gained attention in biometric
authentication because of their non-invasive acquisition, inherent liveness
detection, and suitability for low-cost wearable devices. However, PPG signal
quality is challenged by motion artifacts, illumination changes, and
inter-subject physiological variability, making robust feature extraction and
classification crucial. This study proposes a lightweight and cost-effective
biometric authentication framework based on PPG signals extracted from
low-frame-rate fingertip videos. The CFIHSR dataset, comprising PPG recordings
from 46 subjects at a sampling rate of 14 Hz, is employed for evaluation. The
raw PPG signals undergo a standard preprocessing pipeline involving baseline
drift removal, motion artifact suppression using Principal Component Analysis
(PCA), bandpass filtering, Fourier-based resampling, and amplitude
normalization. To generate robust representations, each one-dimensional PPG
segment is converted into a two-dimensional time-frequency scalogram via the
Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT), effectively capturing transient
cardiovascular dynamics. We developed a hybrid deep learning model, termed
CVT-ConvMixer-LSTM, by combining spatial features from the Convolutional Vision
Transformer (CVT) and ConvMixer branches with temporal features from a Long
Short-Term Memory network (LSTM). The experimental results on 46 subjects
demonstrate an authentication accuracy of 98%, validating the robustness of the
model to noise and variability between subjects. Due to its efficiency,
scalability, and inherent liveness detection capability, the proposed system is
well-suited for real-world mobile and embedded biometric security applications.

TL;DR: Bratrix是一个端到端的多模态语言锚定视觉-大脑对齐框架，通过将视觉刺激分解为层次化视觉和语言语义组件，在共享潜在空间中对齐视觉-语言和大脑-语言嵌入，并引入不确定性感知模块处理噪声神经信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要将神经活动直接与视觉嵌入对齐，但纯视觉表示往往无法捕捉潜在语义维度，限制了可解释性和深度鲁棒性。需要解决主题变异性和视觉特征纠缠的问题。

Method: Bratrix将视觉刺激分解为层次化视觉和语言语义组件，使用可学习的语言锚定语义矩阵增强跨模态相关性，采用两阶段训练策略（单模态预训练+多模态微调），并包含不确定性感知模块进行加权对齐。

Result: 在EEG、MEG和fMRI基准测试中，Bratrix在检索、重建和字幕生成任务上优于最先进方法，特别是在200路EEG检索任务中提升了14.3%。

Conclusion: Bratrix通过多模态语言锚定方法有效解决了视觉语义从神经信号中解码的挑战，提高了对齐精度和性能表现。

Abstract: Unveiling visual semantics from neural signals such as EEG, MEG, and fMRI
remains a fundamental challenge due to subject variability and the entangled
nature of visual features. Existing approaches primarily align neural activity
directly with visual embeddings, but visual-only representations often fail to
capture latent semantic dimensions, limiting interpretability and deep
robustness. To address these limitations, we propose Bratrix, the first
end-to-end framework to achieve multimodal Language-Anchored Vision-Brain
alignment. Bratrix decouples visual stimuli into hierarchical visual and
linguistic semantic components, and projects both visual and brain
representations into a shared latent space, enabling the formation of aligned
visual-language and brain-language embeddings. To emulate human-like perceptual
reliability and handle noisy neural signals, Bratrix incorporates a novel
uncertainty perception module that applies uncertainty-aware weighting during
alignment. By leveraging learnable language-anchored semantic matrices to
enhance cross-modal correlations and employing a two-stage training strategy of
single-modality pretraining followed by multimodal fine-tuning, Bratrix-M
improves alignment precision. Extensive experiments on EEG, MEG, and fMRI
benchmarks demonstrate that Bratrix improves retrieval, reconstruction, and
captioning performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, specifically
surpassing 14.3% in 200-way EEG retrieval task. Code and model are available.

*Abu Hanif Muhammad Syarubany*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文比较了两种无配对自监督CT图像去噪方法：基于CycleGAN的残差翻译器和Noise2Score分数匹配去噪器。CycleGAN在标准U-Net架构下表现最佳，显著提升图像质量；Noise2Score在无干净配对数据时表现稳健。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在无配对和自监督条件下进行CT图像去噪，评估训练数据效率高的方法，为缺乏干净配对数据的实际应用场景提供解决方案。

Method: 采用两种主要方法：1) CycleGAN残差翻译器，使用标准U-Net架构；2) Noise2Score分数匹配去噪器。在统一评估协议下进行配置扫描和收敛训练。

Result: CycleGAN将输入图像从34.66 dB/0.9234 SSIM提升至38.913 dB/0.971 SSIM，获得1.9441估计分数和1.9343未见集分数。Noise2Score在绝对PSNR/SSIM上稍逊，但在高噪声输入时表现优异。

Conclusion: CycleGAN提供最强的最终图像质量，而Noise2Score作为无配对替代方案具有稳健性能，两者在不同场景下各有优势。

Abstract: We study CT image denoising in the unpaired and self-supervised regimes by
evaluating two strong, training-data-efficient paradigms: a CycleGAN-based
residual translator and a Noise2Score (N2S) score-matching denoiser. Under a
common evaluation protocol, a configuration sweep identifies a simple standard
U-Net backbone within CycleGAN (lambda_cycle = 30, lambda_iden = 2, ngf = ndf =
64) as the most reliable setting; we then train it to convergence with a longer
schedule. The selected CycleGAN improves the noisy input from 34.66 dB / 0.9234
SSIM to 38.913 dB / 0.971 SSIM and attains an estimated score of 1.9441 and an
unseen-set (Kaggle leaderboard) score of 1.9343. Noise2Score, while slightly
behind in absolute PSNR / SSIM, achieves large gains over very noisy inputs,
highlighting its utility when clean pairs are unavailable. Overall, CycleGAN
offers the strongest final image quality, whereas Noise2Score provides a robust
pair-free alternative with competitive performance. Source code is available at

TL;DR: SpatialLock是一个新颖的文本到图像生成框架，通过感知信号和定位信息联合控制对象空间位置，解决了现有方法在对象定位精度不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像生成方法未能充分利用位置信息，导致对对象空间布局的理解不足，难以实现精确的对象定位控制。

Method: 提出SpatialLock框架，包含两个组件：位置参与注入(PoI)通过注意力层直接整合空间信息，位置引导学习(PoG)使用基于感知的监督进一步优化对象定位。

Result: 实验表明SpatialLock在精确对象定位方面达到了新的最先进水平，在多个数据集上实现了超过0.9的IOU分数。

Conclusion: SpatialLock能够生成具有精确空间排列的对象，并提高生成图像的视觉质量，为文本到图像生成中的精确对象定位提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) synthesis has made significant advancements in recent
years, driving applications such as generating datasets automatically. However,
precise control over object localization in generated images remains a
challenge. Existing methods fail to fully utilize positional information,
leading to an inadequate understanding of object spatial layouts. To address
this issue, we propose SpatialLock, a novel framework that leverages perception
signals and grounding information to jointly control the generation of spatial
locations. SpatialLock incorporates two components: Position-Engaged Injection
(PoI) and Position-Guided Learning (PoG). PoI directly integrates spatial
information through an attention layer, encouraging the model to learn the
grounding information effectively. PoG employs perception-based supervision to
further refine object localization. Together, these components enable the model
to generate objects with precise spatial arrangements and improve the visual
quality of the generated images. Experiments show that SpatialLock sets a new
state-of-the-art for precise object positioning, achieving IOU scores above 0.9
across multiple datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Tortoise and Hare Guidance (THG)训练免费策略，通过将分类器免费引导(CFG) ODE重新表述为多速率ODE系统，显著加速扩散采样同时保持高保真生成，减少高达30%的函数评估次数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散求解器未能充分利用额外引导分支对数值误差的鲁棒性，存在大量计算冗余，需要开发更高效的采样策略。

Method: 将CFG ODE重新表述为多速率ODE系统，噪声估计在精细时间步网格上积分，额外引导仅在粗网格上积分；引入误差边界感知时间步采样器和引导尺度调度器。

Result: THG减少高达30%的函数评估次数，生成保真度几乎无损失(ΔImageReward ≤ 0.032)，在相同计算预算下优于最先进的CFG训练免费加速器。

Conclusion: 多速率公式在扩散求解器中具有巨大潜力，为实现无需模型重新训练的高质量实时图像合成铺平了道路。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Tortoise and Hare Guidance (THG), a training-free
strategy that accelerates diffusion sampling while maintaining high-fidelity
generation. We demonstrate that the noise estimate and the additional guidance
term exhibit markedly different sensitivity to numerical error by reformulating
the classifier-free guidance (CFG) ODE as a multirate system of ODEs. Our
error-bound analysis shows that the additional guidance branch is more robust
to approximation, revealing substantial redundancy that conventional solvers
fail to exploit. Building on this insight, THG significantly reduces the
computation of the additional guidance: the noise estimate is integrated with
the tortoise equation on the original, fine-grained timestep grid, while the
additional guidance is integrated with the hare equation only on a coarse grid.
We also introduce (i) an error-bound-aware timestep sampler that adaptively
selects step sizes and (ii) a guidance-scale scheduler that stabilizes large
extrapolation spans. THG reduces the number of function evaluations (NFE) by up
to 30% with virtually no loss in generation fidelity ($\Delta$ImageReward
$\leq$ 0.032) and outperforms state-of-the-art CFG-based training-free
accelerators under identical computation budgets. Our findings highlight the
potential of multirate formulations for diffusion solvers, paving the way for
real-time high-quality image synthesis without any model retraining. The source

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有草图生成方法主要关注通用合成，缺乏对草图风格的精确控制机制，需要开发能够通过文本和参考草图进行显式风格引导的方法。

Method: 基于扩散模型的免训练框架，将参考特征作为辅助信息结合线性平滑，使用风格-内容引导机制，并通过联合AdaIN模块支持多风格生成。

Conclusion: M3S框架有效解决了草图风格控制问题，通过创新的风格-内容引导机制显著提升了生成质量，为可控草图生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models have facilitated progress in sketch
generation. However, existing specialized methods primarily focus on generic
synthesis and lack mechanisms for precise control over sketch styles. In this
work, we propose a training-free framework based on diffusion models that
enables explicit style guidance via textual prompts and referenced style
sketches. Unlike previous style transfer methods that overwrite key and value
matrices in self-attention, we incorporate the reference features as auxiliary
information with linear smoothing and leverage a style-content guidance
mechanism. This design effectively reduces content leakage from reference
sketches and enhances synthesis quality, especially in cases with low
structural similarity between reference and target sketches. Furthermore, we
extend our framework to support controllable multi-style generation by
integrating features from multiple reference sketches, coordinated via a joint
AdaIN module. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
high-quality sketch generation with accurate style alignment and improved
flexibility in style control. The official implementation of M3S is available
at https://github.com/CMACH508/M3S.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在真实世界场景中，扫描或拍摄文档的正确方向确定是关键的预处理步骤。准确的旋转校正对于提升OCR等下游任务的性能至关重要，因为用户错误（特别是相机基础方向错误）经常导致图像错位。

Method: 首先引入ORB基准测试，包括ORB-En（基于旋转变换的英文OCR数据集）和ORB-Indic（涵盖11种印度语言的新多语言数据集）。然后提出了基于Phi-3.5-Vision模型视觉编码器的快速、鲁棒、轻量级旋转分类管道，采用动态图像裁剪技术，专门针对4类旋转任务进行微调。

Result: 旋转分类方法在两个数据集上分别达到96%和92%的准确率。在模拟真实世界设置中，该模块显著提升了闭源OCR模型（最高14%）和开源权重模型（最高4倍）的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究不仅提供了评估OCR旋转鲁棒性的新基准，还开发了高效的旋转校正方法，证明了旋转预处理对提升OCR性能的关键作用，特别是在多语言和低资源语言场景中。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in document understanding, determining the
correct orientation of scanned or photographed documents remains a critical
pre-processing step in the real world settings. Accurate rotation correction is
essential for enhancing the performance of downstream tasks such as Optical
Character Recognition (OCR) where misalignment commonly arises due to user
errors, particularly incorrect base orientations of the camera during capture.
In this study, we first introduce OCR-Rotation-Bench (ORB), a new benchmark for
evaluating OCR robustness to image rotations, comprising (i) ORB-En, built from
rotation-transformed structured and free-form English OCR datasets, and (ii)
ORB-Indic, a novel multilingual set spanning 11 Indic mid to low-resource
languages. We also present a fast, robust and lightweight rotation
classification pipeline built on the vision encoder of Phi-3.5-Vision model
with dynamic image cropping, fine-tuned specifically for 4-class rotation task
in a standalone fashion. Our method achieves near-perfect 96% and 92% accuracy
on identifying the rotations respectively on both the datasets. Beyond
classification, we demonstrate the critical role of our module in boosting OCR
performance: closed-source (up to 14%) and open-weights models (up to 4x) in
the simulated real-world setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在数字病理学中，准确配准不同模态的图像对于直接比较和整合信息至关重要，支持生物标志物分析和组织重建等应用。

Method: 使用20个组织样本对，应用不同颜色转换技术（CycleGAN、Macenko、Reinhard、Vahadane）以及反相、对比度调整、强度归一化和去噪等预处理步骤，然后使用VALIS配准方法进行刚性配准和两步非刚性配准。

Result: 在所有方法中，CycleGAN颜色转换在两个场景（原始或反相多模态图像）中都实现了最低的配准误差，其他方法显示出更高的误差。

Conclusion: 在配准前应用颜色转换可以改善不同模态图像之间的对齐，支持数字病理学中更可靠的分析。

Abstract: Image registration refers to the process of spatially aligning two or more
images by mapping them into a common coordinate system, so that corresponding
anatomical or tissue structures are matched across images. In digital
pathology, registration enables direct comparison and integration of
information from different stains or imaging modalities, sup-porting
applications such as biomarker analysis and tissue reconstruction. Accurate
registration of images from different modalities is an essential step in
digital pathology. In this study, we investigated how various color
transformation techniques affect image registration between hematoxylin and
eosin (H&E) stained images and non-linear multimodal images. We used a dataset
of 20 tissue sample pairs, with each pair undergoing several preprocessing
steps, including different color transformation (CycleGAN, Macenko, Reinhard,
Vahadane), inversion, contrast adjustment, intensity normalization, and
denoising. All images were registered using the VALIS registration method,
which first applies rigid registration and then performs non-rigid registration
in two steps on both low and high-resolution images. Registration performance
was evaluated using the relative Target Registration Error (rTRE). We reported
the median of median rTRE values (MMrTRE) and the average of median rTRE values
(AMrTRE) for each method. In addition, we performed a custom point-based
evaluation using ten manually selected key points. Registration was done
separately for two scenarios, using either the original or inverted multimodal
images. In both scenarios, CycleGAN color transformation achieved the lowest
registration errors, while the other methods showed higher errors. These
findings show that applying color transformation before registration improves
alignment between images from different modalities and supports more reliable
analysis in digital pathology.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于高阶统计量（偏度和峰度）的运动风格迁移方法AStF，通过自适应统计融合器和运动一致性正则化，在运动风格迁移任务中表现出优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于均值和方差的图像风格迁移方法在运动数据上表现不足，因为运动具有复杂的动态模式和时空一致性特征，需要更全面的统计建模。

Method: 提出自适应统计融合器(AStF)，包含风格解耦模块(SDM)和高阶多统计注意力机制(HOS-Attn)，结合运动一致性正则化(MCR)判别器进行训练。

Result: 实验结果表明，AStF在运动风格迁移任务中表现出色，超越了现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 通过引入偏度和峰度等更高阶统计量，能够更全面地建模动态风格的时空统计模式，从而提升运动风格迁移的质量。

Abstract: Human motion style transfer allows characters to appear less rigidity and
more realism with specific style. Traditional arbitrary image style transfer
typically process mean and variance which is proved effective. Meanwhile,
similar methods have been adapted for motion style transfer. However, due to
the fundamental differences between images and motion, relying on mean and
variance is insufficient to fully capture the complex dynamic patterns and
spatiotemporal coherence properties of motion data. Building upon this, our key
insight is to bring two more coefficient, skewness and kurtosis, into the
analysis of motion style. Specifically, we propose a novel Adaptive Statistics
Fusor (AStF) which consists of Style Disentanglement Module (SDM) and
High-Order Multi-Statistics Attention (HOS-Attn). We trained our AStF in
conjunction with a Motion Consistency Regularization (MCR) discriminator.
Experimental results show that, by providing a more comprehensive model of the
spatiotemporal statistical patterns inherent in dynamic styles, our proposed
AStF shows proficiency superiority in motion style transfers over
state-of-the-arts. Our code and model are available at

Motivation: 尽管医学影像中的解剖标志点检测传统上依赖领域特定模型，但大规模预训练视觉模型的出现提供了新机会。本文旨在探索人类中心基础模型在医学影像中的潜力，这些模型天生优化了空间姿态定位，为解剖标志点检测提供了强先验。

Method: 通过多数据集预训练，将人类中心基础模型Sapiens适配到医学影像领域，构建MedSapiens模型。

Result: MedSapiens在多个数据集上建立了新的最优性能：相比通用模型平均成功检测率提升5.26%，相比专业模型提升21.81%；在少样本设置下相比少样本最优方法提升2.69%。

Conclusion: 人类中心基础模型为医学影像中的解剖标志点检测提供了强大的先验知识，这一潜力此前未被充分挖掘。MedSapiens证明了这种适配策略的有效性。

Abstract: This paper does not introduce a novel architecture; instead, it revisits a
fundamental yet overlooked baseline: adapting human-centric foundation models
for anatomical landmark detection in medical imaging. While landmark detection
has traditionally relied on domain-specific models, the emergence of
large-scale pre-trained vision models presents new opportunities. In this
study, we investigate the adaptation of Sapiens, a human-centric foundation
model designed for pose estimation, to medical imaging through multi-dataset
pretraining, establishing a new state of the art across multiple datasets. Our
proposed model, MedSapiens, demonstrates that human-centric foundation models,
inherently optimized for spatial pose localization, provide strong priors for
anatomical landmark detection, yet this potential has remained largely
untapped. We benchmark MedSapiens against existing state-of-the-art models,
achieving up to 5.26% improvement over generalist models and up to 21.81%
improvement over specialist models in the average success detection rate (SDR).
To further assess MedSapiens adaptability to novel downstream tasks with few
annotations, we evaluate its performance in limited-data settings, achieving
2.69% improvement over the few-shot state of the art in SDR. Code and model
weights are available at https://github.com/xmed-lab/MedSapiens .

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着合成图像和深度伪造生成模型的日益复杂，源归属和真实性验证成为计算机视觉系统的关键挑战。扩散模型会在输出中无意间留下持续的统计痕迹（信号泄漏），特别是在潜在表示中。

Conclusion: 在潜在空间中建模信号泄漏偏差能够实现可靠且可解释的AI图像和深度伪造取证。

Abstract: The growing sophistication of synthetic image and deepfake generation models
has turned source attribution and authenticity verification into a critical
challenge for modern computer vision systems. Recent studies suggest that
diffusion pipelines unintentionally imprint persistent statistical traces,
known as signal leaks, within their outputs, particularly in latent
representations. Building on this observation, we propose Proto-LeakNet, a
signal-leak-aware and interpretable attribution framework that integrates
closed-set classification with a density-based open-set evaluation on the
learned embeddings, enabling analysis of unseen generators without retraining.
Operating in the latent domain of diffusion models, our method re-simulates
partial forward diffusion to expose residual generator-specific cues. A
temporal attention encoder aggregates multi-step latent features, while a
feature-weighted prototype head structures the embedding space and enables
transparent attribution. Trained solely on closed data and achieving a Macro
AUC of 98.13%, Proto-LeakNet learns a latent geometry that remains robust under
post-processing, surpassing state-of-the-art methods, and achieves strong
separability between known and unseen generators. These results demonstrate
that modeling signal-leak bias in latent space enables reliable and
interpretable AI-image and deepfake forensics. The code for the whole work will
be available upon submission.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要利用模态不变的外观特征，但忽略了同样模态不变且富含时间动态信息的步态特征，限制了跨模态视频匹配的时空一致性建模能力。

Method: 提出语义感知轮廓和步态学习模型(SASGL)，利用DINOv2生成增强轮廓表示，并与ReID目标联合优化；开发渐进式双向多粒度增强模块(PBMGE)，在多个空间粒度上实现步态和外观流的双向交互。

Conclusion: DinoGRL框架通过结合DINOv2的视觉先验和步态特征学习，实现了鲁棒的序列级表示，有效提升了跨模态行人重识别性能。

Abstract: Video-based Visible-Infrared person re-identification (VVI-ReID) aims to
retrieve the same pedestrian across visible and infrared modalities from video
sequences. Existing methods tend to exploit modality-invariant visual features
but largely overlook gait features, which are not only modality-invariant but
also rich in temporal dynamics, thus limiting their ability to model the
spatiotemporal consistency essential for cross-modal video matching. To address
these challenges, we propose a DINOv2-Driven Gait Representation Learning
(DinoGRL) framework that leverages the rich visual priors of DINOv2 to learn
gait features complementary to appearance cues, facilitating robust
sequence-level representations for cross-modal retrieval. Specifically, we
introduce a Semantic-Aware Silhouette and Gait Learning (SASGL) model, which
generates and enhances silhouette representations with general-purpose semantic
priors from DINOv2 and jointly optimizes them with the ReID objective to
achieve semantically enriched and task-adaptive gait feature learning.
Furthermore, we develop a Progressive Bidirectional Multi-Granularity
Enhancement (PBMGE) module, which progressively refines feature representations
by enabling bidirectional interactions between gait and appearance streams
across multiple spatial granularities, fully leveraging their complementarity
to enhance global representations with rich local details and produce highly
discriminative features. Extensive experiments on HITSZ-VCM and BUPT datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our approach, significantly outperforming
existing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: The dominant 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) acceleration methods fail to
properly regulate the number of Gaussians during training, causing redundant
computational time overhead. In this paper, we propose FastGS, a novel, simple,

TL;DR: 本研究将通用视觉基础模型适配到除草剂试验表征领域，通过自监督学习在农业数据集上训练，显著提升了物种识别和损伤分类性能，特别是在未见条件下的表现更好，并能大幅减少标注需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 除草剂田间试验需要准确识别植物物种和评估除草剂引起的损伤，但通用视觉基础模型在农业领域的细粒度区分能力有限，需要专门优化。

Method: 采用自监督学习方法在大型农业数据集上训练领域特定的视觉基础模型，学习针对除草剂试验图像的丰富可迁移表示。

Result: 领域特定模型在物种识别F1分数从0.91提升到0.94，损伤分类从0.26提升到0.33；在未见条件下提升更显著（物种识别从0.56到0.66，损伤分类从0.17到0.27）；在无人机图像等域偏移场景下保持强性能。

Conclusion: 领域特定的基础模型具有强大的泛化能力，能显著减少人工标注工作量，为除草剂试验分析提供可扩展的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Herbicide field trials require accurate identification of plant species and
assessment of herbicide-induced damage across diverse environments. While
general-purpose vision foundation models have shown promising results in
complex visual domains, their performance can be limited in agriculture, where
fine-grained distinctions between species and damage types are critical.
  In this work, we adapt a general-purpose vision foundation model to herbicide
trial characterization. Trained using a self-supervised learning approach on a
large, curated agricultural dataset, the model learns rich and transferable
representations optimized for herbicide trials images.
  Our domain-specific model significantly outperforms the best general-purpose
foundation model in both species identification (F1 score improvement from 0.91
to 0.94) and damage classification (from 0.26 to 0.33). Under unseen conditions
(new locations and other time), it achieves even greater gains (species
identification from 0.56 to 0.66; damage classification from 0.17 to 0.27). In
domain-shift scenarios, such as drone imagery, it maintains strong performance
(species classification from 0.49 to 0.60).
  Additionally, we show that domain-specific pretraining enhances segmentation
accuracy, particularly in low-annotation regimes. An annotation-efficiency
analysis reveals that, under unseen conditions, the domain-specific model
achieves 5.4% higher F1 score than the general-purpose model, while using 80%
fewer labeled samples.
  These results demonstrate the generalization capabilities of domain-specific
foundation models and their potential to significantly reduce manual annotation
efforts, offering a scalable and automated solution for herbicide trial
analysis.

*Robin Spanier,Thorsten Hoeser,Claudia Kuenzer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究使用合成和真实Sentinel-1卫星图像训练YOLOv10模型，评估合成数据在海洋基础设施检测中的效果，证明模型能够泛化到未见区域，并显著提升检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着海洋基础设施的快速扩张，需要有效的监测系统。现有模型在样本稀缺时表现不佳，特别是对于代表性不足的物体类别、形状和尺寸。

Method: 结合合成和真实Sentinel-1卫星图像训练YOLOv10目标检测模型，在四个区域（里海、南海、几内亚湾、巴西海岸）进行训练，并在三个未见区域（墨西哥湾、北海、波斯湾）评估地理可转移性。

Result: 共检测到3,529个海上平台（北海411个、墨西哥湾1,519个、波斯湾1,593个）。模型F1得分为0.85，加入合成数据后提升至0.90，证明模型能够泛化到训练区域之外。

Conclusion: 合成数据生成是解决遥感中常见挑战的有效策略，展示了深度学习在全球可扩展海洋基础设施监测方面的潜力，强调了平衡数据集的重要性。

Abstract: The recent and ongoing expansion of marine infrastructure, including offshore
wind farms, oil and gas platforms, artificial islands, and aquaculture
facilities, highlights the need for effective monitoring systems. The
development of robust models for offshore infrastructure detection relies on
comprehensive, balanced datasets, but falls short when samples are scarce,
particularly for underrepresented object classes, shapes, and sizes. By
training deep learning-based YOLOv10 object detection models with a combination
of synthetic and real Sentinel-1 satellite imagery acquired in the fourth
quarter of 2023 from four regions (Caspian Sea, South China Sea, Gulf of
Guinea, and Coast of Brazil), this study investigates the use of synthetic
training data to enhance model performance. We evaluated this approach by
applying the model to detect offshore platforms in three unseen regions (Gulf
of Mexico, North Sea, Persian Gulf) and thereby assess geographic
transferability. This region-holdout evaluation demonstrated that the model
generalises beyond the training areas. In total, 3,529 offshore platforms were
detected, including 411 in the North Sea, 1,519 in the Gulf of Mexico, and
1,593 in the Persian Gulf. The model achieved an F1 score of 0.85, which
improved to 0.90 upon incorporating synthetic data. We analysed how synthetic
data enhances the representation of unbalanced classes and overall model
performance, taking a first step toward globally transferable detection of
offshore infrastructure. This study underscores the importance of balanced
datasets and highlights synthetic data generation as an effective strategy to
address common challenges in remote sensing, demonstrating the potential of
deep learning for scalable, global offshore infrastructure monitoring.

TL;DR: RISE-T2V是一个创新的文本到视频生成框架，通过集成提示词重述和语义特征提取，解决了现有模型在简洁提示词下视频质量下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到视频扩散模型依赖预训练文本编码器进行语义对齐，但在简洁提示词下往往无法保持视频质量，且无法在线重述提示词以更好地匹配用户意图。

Method: 提出RISE-T2V框架，集成提示词重述和语义特征提取为单一步骤，引入Rephrasing Adapter模块，利用LLM在下一个token预测时的文本隐藏状态作为视频生成条件。

Result: RISE-T2V是一个通用框架，可应用于各种预训练LLM和视频扩散模型，显著增强了文本到视频任务的能力，能够生成更符合用户意图的高质量视频。

Conclusion: 该框架通过隐式重述基本提示词为更全面的表示，并利用LLM的强大能力扩展了视频生成模型的应用范围，实验证明其适用于不同的视频扩散模型架构。

Abstract: Most text-to-video(T2V) diffusion models depend on pre-trained text encoders
for semantic alignment, yet they often fail to maintain video quality when
provided with concise prompts rather than well-designed ones. The primary issue
lies in their limited textual semantics understanding. Moreover, these text
encoders cannot rephrase prompts online to better align with user intentions,
which limits both the scalability and usability of the models, To address these
challenges, we introduce RISE-T2V, which uniquely integrates the processes of
prompt rephrasing and semantic feature extraction into a single and seamless
step instead of two separate steps. RISE-T2V is universal and can be applied to
various pre-trained LLMs and video diffusion models(VDMs), significantly
enhancing their capabilities for T2V tasks. We propose an innovative module
called the Rephrasing Adapter, enabling diffusion models to utilize text hidden
states during the next token prediction of the LLM as a condition for video
generation. By employing a Rephrasing Adapter, the video generation model can
implicitly rephrase basic prompts into more comprehensive representations that
better match the user's intent. Furthermore, we leverage the powerful
capabilities of LLMs to enable video generation models to accomplish a broader
range of T2V tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RISE-T2V is a
versatile framework applicable to different video diffusion model
architectures, significantly enhancing the ability of T2V models to generate
high-quality videos that align with user intent. Visual results are available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了传感器遮挡对BEVFusion架构3D物体检测性能的影响，发现在nuScenes数据集上，相机遮挡导致41.3%的mAP下降，LiDAR在重度遮挡下下降47.3%，融合设置中LiDAR遮挡影响更大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究环境条件（如雾、霾或物理障碍）引起的传感器遮挡对基于BEV的多模态融合3D检测精度的影响，这一问题目前尚未充分探索。

Method: 使用BEVFusion架构，在nuScenes数据集上评估相机和LiDAR传感器遮挡对3D物体检测性能的影响，使用mAP和NDS作为性能指标。

Result: 相机中度遮挡导致仅相机检测的mAP下降41.3%（从35.6%到20.9%）；LiDAR仅在重度遮挡下性能急剧下降47.3%（从64.7%到34.1%）；融合设置中相机遮挡仅导致4.1%下降，而LiDAR遮挡导致26.8%下降。

Conclusion: 模型对LiDAR的依赖更强，需要未来研究开发遮挡感知的评估方法和改进的传感器融合技术，以在部分传感器失效或环境条件恶化时保持检测精度。

Abstract: Accurate 3D object detection is essential for automated vehicles to navigate
safely in complex real-world environments. Bird's Eye View (BEV)
representations, which project multi-sensor data into a top-down spatial
format, have emerged as a powerful approach for robust perception. Although
BEV-based fusion architectures have demonstrated strong performance through
multimodal integration, the effects of sensor occlusions, caused by
environmental conditions such as fog, haze, or physical obstructions, on 3D
detection accuracy remain underexplored. In this work, we investigate the
impact of occlusions on both camera and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)
outputs using the BEVFusion architecture, evaluated on the nuScenes dataset.
Detection performance is measured using mean Average Precision (mAP) and the
nuScenes Detection Score (NDS). Our results show that moderate camera
occlusions lead to a 41.3% drop in mAP (from 35.6% to 20.9%) when detection is
based only on the camera. On the other hand, LiDAR sharply drops in performance
only under heavy occlusion, with mAP falling by 47.3% (from 64.7% to 34.1%),
with a severe impact on long-range detection. In fused settings, the effect
depends on which sensor is occluded: occluding the camera leads to a minor 4.1%
drop (from 68.5% to 65.7%), while occluding LiDAR results in a larger 26.8%
drop (to 50.1%), revealing the model's stronger reliance on LiDAR for the task
of 3D object detection. Our results highlight the need for future research into
occlusion-aware evaluation methods and improved sensor fusion techniques that
can maintain detection accuracy in the presence of partial sensor failure or
degradation due to adverse environmental conditions.

Abstract: Background In analytical chemistry, spatial information about materials is
commonly captured through imaging techniques, such as traditional color cameras
or with advanced hyperspectral cameras and microscopes. However, efficiently
extracting and analyzing this spatial information for exploratory and
predictive purposes remains a challenge, especially when using traditional
chemometric methods. Recent advances in deep learning and artificial
intelligence have significantly enhanced image processing capabilities,
enabling the extraction of multiscale deep features that are otherwise
challenging to capture with conventional image processing techniques. Despite
the wide availability of open-source deep learning models, adoption in
analytical chemistry remains limited because of the absence of structured,
step-by-step guidance for implementing these models.
  Results This tutorial aims to bridge this gap by providing a step-by-step
guide for applying deep learning approaches to extract spatial information from
imaging data and integrating it with other data sources, such as spectral
information. Importantly, the focus of this work is not on training deep
learning models for image processing but on using existing open source models
to extract deep features from imaging data.
  Significance The tutorial provides MATLAB code tutorial demonstrations,
showcasing the processing of imaging data from various imaging modalities
commonly encountered in analytical chemistry. Readers must run the tutorial
steps on their own datasets using the codes presented in this tutorial.

Conclusion: BoRe-Depth模型在嵌入式系统上实现了高效准确的单目深度估计，显著改善了边界质量，为无人系统的3D感知提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Depth estimation is one of the key technologies for realizing 3D perception
in unmanned systems. Monocular depth estimation has been widely researched
because of its low?cost advantage, but the existing methods face the challenges
of poor depth estimation performance and blurred object boundaries on embedded
systems. In this paper, we propose a novel monocular depth estimation model,
BoRe-Depth, which contains only 8.7M parameters. It can accurately estimate
depth maps on embedded systems and significantly improves boundary quality.
Firstly, we design an Enhanced Feature Adaptive Fusion Module (EFAF) which
adaptively fuses depth features to enhance boundary detail representation.
Secondly, we integrate semantic knowledge into the encoder to improve the
object recognition and boundary perception capabilities. Finally, BoRe-Depth is
deployed on NVIDIA Jetson Orin, and runs efficiently at 50.7 FPS. We
demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms previous
lightweight models on multiple challenging datasets, and we provide detailed
ablation studies for the proposed methods. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了HideAndSeg工具，用于在自然环境中自动分割章鱼视频，通过结合SAM2和YOLOv11实现最小化监督的AI分割方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于章鱼的伪装能力、皮肤纹理颜色快速变化、非刚性身体变形以及频繁遮挡，加上水下光照和浑浊度变化，在自然栖息地分析章鱼具有挑战性。缺乏大规模标注数据集也限制了相关研究。

Method: 集成SAM2与自定义训练的YOLOv11目标检测器。用户首先提供点坐标生成初始分割掩码，这些掩码作为YOLO模型的训练数据。然后通过边界框提示完全自动化管道，无需进一步手动干预。引入两个无监督指标评估分割质量。

Result: HideAndSeg实现了令人满意的性能，相比手动提示方法减少了分割噪声。在自然环境中完全遮挡后仍能重新识别和分割章鱼，而手动提示模型在此场景下会失败。

Conclusion: 通过减少真实场景中手动分析的需求，该工作为野生头足类动物行为研究提供了实用工具，开辟了更高效研究途径。

Abstract: Analyzing octopuses in their natural habitats is challenging due to their
camouflage capability, rapid changes in skin texture and color, non-rigid body
deformations, and frequent occlusions, all of which are compounded by variable
underwater lighting and turbidity. Addressing the lack of large-scale annotated
datasets, this paper introduces HideAndSeg, a novel, minimally supervised
AI-based tool for segmenting videos of octopuses. It establishes a quantitative
baseline for this task. HideAndSeg integrates SAM2 with a custom-trained
YOLOv11 object detector. First, the user provides point coordinates to generate
the initial segmentation masks with SAM2. These masks serve as training data
for the YOLO model. After that, our approach fully automates the pipeline by
providing a bounding box prompt to SAM2, eliminating the need for further
manual intervention. We introduce two unsupervised metrics - temporal
consistency $DICE_t$ and new component count $NC_t$ - to quantitatively
evaluate segmentation quality and guide mask refinement in the absence of
ground-truth data, i.e., real-world information that serves to train, validate,
and test AI models. Results show that HideAndSeg achieves satisfactory
performance, reducing segmentation noise compared to the manually prompted
approach. Our method can re-identify and segment the octopus even after periods
of complete occlusion in natural environments, a scenario in which the manually
prompted model fails. By reducing the need for manual analysis in real-world
scenarios, this work provides a practical tool that paves the way for more
efficient behavioral studies of wild cephalopods.

Abstract: Jigsaw puzzle solving requires the rearrangement of unordered pieces into
their original pose in order to reconstruct a coherent whole, often an image,
and is known to be an intractable problem. While the possible impact of
automatic puzzle solvers can be disruptive in various application domains, most
of the literature has focused on developing solvers for square jigsaw puzzles,
severely limiting their practical use. In this work, we significantly expand
the types of puzzles handled computationally, focusing on what is known as
Convex Partitions, a major subset of polygonal puzzles whose pieces are convex.
We utilize both geometrical and pictorial compatibilities, introduce a greedy
solver, and report several performance measures next to the first benchmark

Abstract: Empowering Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to deeply integrate image
interaction with long-horizon reasoning capabilities remains a long-standing
challenge in this field. Recent advances in vision-centric reasoning explore a
promising "Thinking with Images" paradigm for LMMs, marking a shift from
image-assisted reasoning to image-interactive thinking. While this milestone
enables models to focus on fine-grained image regions, progress remains
constrained by limited visual tool spaces and task-specific workflow designs.
To bridge this gap, we present V-Thinker, a general-purpose multimodal
reasoning assistant that enables interactive, vision-centric thinking through
end-to-end reinforcement learning. V-Thinker comprises two key components: (1)
a Data Evolution Flywheel that automatically synthesizes, evolves, and verifies
interactive reasoning datasets across three dimensions-diversity, quality, and
difficulty; and (2) a Visual Progressive Training Curriculum that first aligns
perception via point-level supervision, then integrates interactive reasoning
through a two-stage reinforcement learning framework. Furthermore, we introduce
VTBench, an expert-verified benchmark targeting vision-centric interactive
reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that V-Thinker consistently
outperforms strong LMM-based baselines in both general and interactive
reasoning scenarios, providing valuable insights for advancing
image-interactive reasoning applications.

Abstract: Landslides cause severe damage to lives, infrastructure, and the environment,
making accurate and timely mapping essential for disaster preparedness and
response. However, conventional deep learning models often struggle when
applied across different sensors, regions, or under conditions of limited
training data. To address these challenges, we present a three-axis analytical
framework of sensor, label, and domain for adapting geospatial foundation
models (GeoFMs), focusing on Prithvi-EO-2.0 for landslide mapping. Through a
series of experiments, we show that it consistently outperforms task-specific
CNNs (U-Net, U-Net++), vision transformers (Segformer, SwinV2-B), and other
GeoFMs (TerraMind, SatMAE). The model, built on global pretraining,
self-supervision, and adaptable fine-tuning, proved resilient to spectral
variation, maintained accuracy under label scarcity, and generalized more
reliably across diverse datasets and geographic settings. Alongside these
strengths, we also highlight remaining challenges such as computational cost
and the limited availability of reusable AI-ready training data for landslide
research. Overall, our study positions GeoFMs as a step toward more robust and
scalable approaches for landslide risk reduction and environmental monitoring.

Motivation: 视频生成技术快速发展，但评估指标的发展滞后。目前说话头部生成评估主要依赖有限指标、一般视频质量评估、唇部同步和用户研究，缺乏全面系统的评估框架。

Method: 提出了包含8个指标的新评估框架，涵盖三个维度：质量、自然性和同步性。重点分析头部、嘴部和眉毛的细粒度动态，以及面部质量。在17个最先进模型生成的85,000个视频上进行广泛实验。

Abstract: Video generation has achieved remarkable progress, with generated videos
increasingly resembling real ones. However, the rapid advance in generation has
outpaced the development of adequate evaluation metrics. Currently, the
assessment of talking head generation primarily relies on limited metrics,
evaluating general video quality, lip synchronization, and on conducting user
studies. Motivated by this, we propose a new evaluation framework comprising 8
metrics related to three dimensions (i) quality, (ii) naturalness, and (iii)
synchronization. In selecting the metrics, we place emphasis on efficiency, as
well as alignment with human preferences. Based on this considerations, we
streamline to analyze fine-grained dynamics of head, mouth, and eyebrows, as
well as face quality. Our extensive experiments on 85,000 videos generated by
17 state-of-the-art models suggest that while many algorithms excel in lip
synchronization, they face challenges with generating expressiveness and
artifact-free details. These videos were generated based on a novel real
dataset, that we have curated, in order to mitigate bias of training data. Our
proposed benchmark framework is aimed at evaluating the improvement of
generative methods. Original code, dataset and leaderboards will be publicly
released and regularly updated with new methods, in order to reflect progress
in the field.

TL;DR: STC-Net是一个用于腹腔镜胆囊切除术中基于Parkland分级量表的单时间戳复杂性评估框架，能够在弱时间监督下处理完整手术视频，通过联合执行时间定位和分级，在真实场景中实现自动化手术复杂性评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确评估腹腔镜胆囊切除术的手术复杂性至关重要，因为严重炎症与更长的手术时间和更高的术后并发症风险相关。Parkland分级量表提供了临床验证的炎症严重程度分层框架，但其在手术视频中的自动化应用仍未被充分探索，特别是在需要分析完整视频而无人工预处理的现实场景中。

Method: 提出了STC-Net框架，通过定位、窗口提议和分级模块联合执行时间定位和分级。引入了结合硬和软定位目标以及背景感知分级监督的新损失函数公式。该方法直接在完整视频上操作，不同于仅限于静态图像或手动修剪片段的先前方法。

Result: 在包含1,859个腹腔镜胆囊切除术视频的私有数据集上评估，STC-Net达到62.11%的准确率和61.42%的F1分数，在两项指标上均优于非定位基线方法超过10%，突显了弱监督在外科复杂性评估中的有效性。

Conclusion: STC-Net展示了从完整腹腔镜胆囊切除术视频中进行基于Parkland分级量表的自动化手术复杂性评估的可扩展且有效的方法，使其在术后分析和外科培训方面具有应用前景。

Abstract: Purpose: Accurate assessment of surgical complexity is essential in
Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy (LC), where severe inflammation is associated with
longer operative times and increased risk of postoperative complications. The
Parkland Grading Scale (PGS) provides a clinically validated framework for
stratifying inflammation severity; however, its automation in surgical videos
remains largely unexplored, particularly in realistic scenarios where complete
videos must be analyzed without prior manual curation. Methods: In this work,
we introduce STC-Net, a novel framework for SingleTimestamp-based Complexity
estimation in LC via the PGS, designed to operate under weak temporal
supervision. Unlike prior methods limited to static images or manually trimmed
clips, STC-Net operates directly on full videos. It jointly performs temporal
localization and grading through a localization, window proposal, and grading
module. We introduce a novel loss formulation combining hard and soft
localization objectives and background-aware grading supervision. Results:
Evaluated on a private dataset of 1,859 LC videos, STC-Net achieves an accuracy
of 62.11% and an F1-score of 61.42%, outperforming non-localized baselines by
over 10% in both metrics and highlighting the effectiveness of weak supervision
for surgical complexity assessment. Conclusion: STC-Net demonstrates a scalable
and effective approach for automated PGS-based surgical complexity estimation
from full LC videos, making it promising for post-operative analysis and
surgical training.

TL;DR: UniSplat是一个用于自动驾驶的前馈3D重建框架，通过统一的潜在时空融合学习鲁棒的动态场景重建，解决了稀疏、非重叠相机视图和复杂场景动态的联合挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理稀疏、非重叠相机视图和复杂场景动态的联合挑战时存在困难，需要一种能够鲁棒重建动态场景的通用框架。

Method: 构建3D潜在支架作为结构化表示，利用预训练基础模型捕获几何和语义场景上下文；引入在3D支架内直接操作的高效融合机制实现一致的时空对齐；设计双分支解码器，结合点锚定细化和基于体素的生成，从融合支架生成动态感知高斯，并维护静态高斯的持久内存以实现流式场景补全。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的广泛实验表明，UniSplat在新视图合成方面达到最先进性能，即使在原始相机覆盖范围之外的视点也能提供鲁棒和高质量的渲染。

Conclusion: UniSplat通过统一的潜在时空融合框架，成功解决了自动驾驶中动态场景重建的关键挑战，实现了鲁棒和高质量的3D重建效果。

Abstract: Feed-forward 3D reconstruction for autonomous driving has advanced rapidly,
yet existing methods struggle with the joint challenges of sparse,
non-overlapping camera views and complex scene dynamics. We present UniSplat, a
general feed-forward framework that learns robust dynamic scene reconstruction
through unified latent spatio-temporal fusion. UniSplat constructs a 3D latent
scaffold, a structured representation that captures geometric and semantic
scene context by leveraging pretrained foundation models. To effectively
integrate information across spatial views and temporal frames, we introduce an
efficient fusion mechanism that operates directly within the 3D scaffold,
enabling consistent spatio-temporal alignment. To ensure complete and detailed
reconstructions, we design a dual-branch decoder that generates dynamic-aware
Gaussians from the fused scaffold by combining point-anchored refinement with
voxel-based generation, and maintain a persistent memory of static Gaussians to
enable streaming scene completion beyond current camera coverage. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that UniSplat achieves
state-of-the-art performance in novel view synthesis, while providing robust
and high-quality renderings even for viewpoints outside the original camera
coverage.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PixCLIP是一个新颖的框架，通过同时处理视觉提示输入和长文本描述来增强CLIP模型的细粒度图像-文本对齐能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注增加视觉信息处理的粒度，但CLIP文本编码器的token长度限制阻碍了处理更细粒度文本信息的能力。需要同时提升视觉和文本内容处理的粒度。

Method: 1) 建立自动标注流水线生成像素级定位的长文本描述，构建LongGRIT数据集；2) 用LLM替换CLIP的原始文本编码器；3) 提出三分支像素-文本对齐学习框架。

Result: PixCLIP在像素级交互和处理长文本方面取得突破，实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过同时增强视觉和文本处理的粒度，PixCLIP有效提升了细粒度视觉语言对齐能力。

Abstract: While the Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining(CLIP) model has achieved
remarkable success in a variety of downstream vison language understanding
tasks, enhancing its capability for fine-grained image-text alignment remains
an active research focus. To this end, most existing works adopt the strategy
of explicitly increasing the granularity of visual information processing,
e.g., incorporating visual prompts to guide the model focus on specific local
regions within the image. Meanwhile, researches on Multimodal Large Language
Models(MLLMs) have demonstrated that training with long and detailed textual
descriptions can effectively improve the model's fine-grained vision-language
alignment. However, the inherent token length limitation of CLIP's text encoder
fundamentally limits CLIP to process more granular textual information embedded
in long text sequences. To synergistically leverage the advantages of enhancing
both visual and textual content processing granularity, we propose PixCLIP, a
novel framework designed to concurrently accommodate visual prompt inputs and
process lengthy textual descriptions. Specifically, we first establish an
automated annotation pipeline capable of generating pixel-level localized,
long-form textual descriptions for images. Utilizing this pipeline, we
construct LongGRIT, a high-quality dataset comprising nearly 1.5 million
samples. Secondly, we replace CLIP's original text encoder with the LLM and
propose a three-branch pixel-text alignment learning framework, facilitating
fine-grained alignment between image regions and corresponding textual
descriptions at arbitrary granularity. Experiments demonstrate that PixCLIP
showcases breakthroughs in pixel-level interaction and handling long-form
texts, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

*Tushar Kataria,Shikha Dubey,Mary Bronner,Jolanta Jedrzkiewicz,Ben J. Brintz,Shireen Y. Elhabian,Beatrice S. Knudsen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个自动化的、基于准确性的框架来评估虚拟IHC染色图像质量，使用颜色反卷积生成IHC阳性像素掩码，通过Dice、IoU等指标直接量化染色准确性，发现传统图像保真度指标与染色准确性相关性差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型可以从H&E图像生成虚拟IHC染色，但当前基于纹理和分布的图像质量评估方法只能量化图像保真度，无法评估IHC染色的准确性。

Method: 使用颜色反卷积生成IHC阳性像素掩码，计算Dice、IoU、Hausdorff距离等染色准确性指标，评估16个配对和非配对图像翻译模型。

Result: 传统图像保真度指标（FID、PSNR、SSIM）与染色准确性和病理学家评估相关性差；配对模型（PyramidPix2Pix、AdaptiveNCE）染色准确性最高；全玻片图像评估显示补丁级评估无法发现的性能下降。

Conclusion: 该框架为评估虚拟IHC模型质量提供了可重复的方法，是加速病理学家常规使用的关键步骤。

Abstract: Deep learning models can generate virtual immunohistochemistry (IHC) stains
from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) images, offering a scalable and low-cost
alternative to laboratory IHC. However, reliable evaluation of image quality
remains a challenge as current texture- and distribution-based metrics quantify
image fidelity rather than the accuracy of IHC staining. Here, we introduce an
automated and accuracy grounded framework to determine image quality across
sixteen paired or unpaired image translation models. Using color deconvolution,
we generate masks of pixels stained brown (i.e., IHC-positive) as predicted by
each virtual IHC model. We use the segmented masks of real and virtual IHC to
compute stain accuracy metrics (Dice, IoU, Hausdorff distance) that directly
quantify correct pixel - level labeling without needing expert manual
annotations. Our results demonstrate that conventional image fidelity metrics,
including Frechet Inception Distance (FID), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR),
and structural similarity (SSIM), correlate poorly with stain accuracy and
pathologist assessment. Paired models such as PyramidPix2Pix and AdaptiveNCE
achieve the highest stain accuracy, whereas unpaired diffusion- and GAN-based
models are less reliable in providing accurate IHC positive pixel labels.
Moreover, whole-slide images (WSI) reveal performance declines that are
invisible in patch-based evaluations, emphasizing the need for WSI-level
benchmarks. Together, this framework defines a reproducible approach for
assessing the quality of virtual IHC models, a critical step to accelerate
translation towards routine use by pathologists.

*Kylie Cancilla,Alexander Moore,Amar Saini,Carmen Carrano*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种可扩展的流式视频质量评估模型，该模型无需参考视频且无需人工标注，通过利用DAVIS数据集的合成退化训练时域感知卷积架构来直接预测全参考指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频质量评估方法存在局限性：全参考方法需要干净参考视频，大多数无参考模型依赖昂贵的人工标注，而大多数无人工标注的无参考方法是基于图像的，忽略了视频物体检测中关键的时域上下文。

Method: 利用DAVIS数据集的合成退化，训练时域感知卷积架构来直接从退化视频预测全参考指标（LPIPS、PSNR、SSIM），在推理时无需参考视频。

Result: 流式方法在泛化到各种退化方面优于基于图像的基线，并且与全参考指标的相关性比广泛使用的BRISQUE基线更高。

Conclusion: 时域建模对于现实世界视觉系统中可扩展的视频质量评估具有重要价值，提出的时域感知、无人工标注方法有效且优于现有基线。

Abstract: Video quality assessment (VQA) is vital for computer vision tasks, but
existing approaches face major limitations: full-reference (FR) metrics require
clean reference videos, and most no-reference (NR) models depend on training on
costly human opinion labels. Moreover, most opinion-unaware NR methods are
image-based, ignoring temporal context critical for video object detection. In
this work, we present a scalable, streaming-based VQA model that is both
no-reference and opinion-unaware. Our model leverages synthetic degradations of
the DAVIS dataset, training a temporal-aware convolutional architecture to
predict FR metrics (LPIPS , PSNR, SSIM) directly from degraded video, without
references at inference. We show that our streaming approach outperforms our
own image-based baseline by generalizing across diverse degradations,
underscoring the value of temporal modeling for scalable VQA in real-world
vision systems. Additionally, we demonstrate that our model achieves higher
correlation with full-reference metrics compared to BRISQUE, a widely-used
opinion-aware image quality assessment baseline, validating the effectiveness
of our temporal, opinion-unaware approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种诊断和去偏多模态基准测试的方法，通过测试集压力测试和迭代偏置剪枝来识别和消除非视觉偏见，提高基准测试的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型的基准测试存在严重问题，模型可以通过利用偏见、语言先验和表面模式来获得高分，而无需真正的视觉理解能力，这削弱了基准测试的有效性。

Method: 采用测试集压力测试方法，通过仅使用测试集的文本输入对大型语言模型进行k折交叉验证来揭示捷径性能，并配合基于随机森林的轻量级诊断；然后使用迭代偏置剪枝程序过滤高偏见样本。

Result: 在四个基准测试（VSI-Bench、CV-Bench、MMMU和VideoMME）中发现了普遍存在的非视觉偏见，并通过案例研究创建了VSI-Bench-Debiased，显著降低了非视觉可解性。

Conclusion: 基准测试设计应采用诊断原则，主动识别和消除非视觉偏见，确保评估真正反映模型的视觉理解能力而非利用测试集模式的能力。

Abstract: Robust benchmarks are crucial for evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs). Yet we find that models can ace many multimodal benchmarks without
strong visual understanding, instead exploiting biases, linguistic priors, and
superficial patterns. This is especially problematic for vision-centric
benchmarks that are meant to require visual inputs. We adopt a diagnostic
principle for benchmark design: if a benchmark can be gamed, it will be.
Designers should therefore try to ``game'' their own benchmarks first, using
diagnostic and debiasing procedures to systematically identify and mitigate
non-visual biases. Effective diagnosis requires directly ``training on the test
set'' -- probing the released test set for its intrinsic, exploitable patterns.
  We operationalize this standard with two components. First, we diagnose
benchmark susceptibility using a ``Test-set Stress-Test'' (TsT) methodology.
Our primary diagnostic tool involves fine-tuning a powerful Large Language
Model via $k$-fold cross-validation on exclusively the non-visual, textual
inputs of the test set to reveal shortcut performance and assign each sample a
bias score $s(x)$. We complement this with a lightweight Random Forest-based
diagnostic operating on hand-crafted features for fast, interpretable auditing.
Second, we debias benchmarks by filtering high-bias samples using an
``Iterative Bias Pruning'' (IBP) procedure. Applying this framework to four
benchmarks -- VSI-Bench, CV-Bench, MMMU, and VideoMME -- we uncover pervasive
non-visual biases. As a case study, we apply our full framework to create
VSI-Bench-Debiased, demonstrating reduced non-visual solvability and a wider
vision-blind performance gap than the original.

TL;DR: SIMS-V是一个利用3D模拟器生成空间丰富视频训练数据的框架，通过系统消融实验发现三个关键问题类别（度量测量、视角依赖推理和时间跟踪）能最有效地培养可迁移的空间智能，仅用25K模拟样本训练的7B参数视频LLM在真实世界空间推理基准上超越了72B基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态语言模型在时空空间推理方面存在困难，而获取具有精确空间标注的多样化真实视频数据存在瓶颈，因此需要利用3D模拟器的特权信息来生成高质量的训练数据。

Method: 提出SIMS-V框架，利用3D模拟器生成空间丰富的视频训练数据，通过系统消融实验分析问题类型、混合方式和规模对真实世界迁移效果的影响。

Result: 识别出三个最有效的问题类别，仅用25K模拟样本训练的7B参数模型在真实世界空间推理基准上超越了72B基线模型，并与专有模型性能相当，同时保持了通用视频理解能力。

Conclusion: 模拟数据可以有效培养多模态语言模型的空间推理能力，通过精心选择的问题类别可以实现高效训练和强大的真实世界泛化性能。

Abstract: Despite impressive high-level video comprehension, multimodal language models
struggle with spatial reasoning across time and space. While current spatial
training approaches rely on real-world video data, obtaining diverse footage
with precise spatial annotations remains a bottleneck. To alleviate this
bottleneck, we present SIMS-V -- a systematic data-generation framework that
leverages the privileged information of 3D simulators to create spatially-rich
video training data for multimodal language models. Using this framework, we
investigate which properties of simulated data drive effective real-world
transfer through systematic ablations of question types, mixes, and scales. We
identify a minimal set of three question categories (metric measurement,
perspective-dependent reasoning, and temporal tracking) that prove most
effective for developing transferable spatial intelligence, outperforming
comprehensive coverage despite using fewer question types. These insights
enable highly efficient training: our 7B-parameter video LLM fine-tuned on just
25K simulated examples outperforms the larger 72B baseline and achieves
competitive performance with proprietary models on rigorous real-world spatial
reasoning benchmarks. Our approach demonstrates robust generalization,
maintaining performance on general video understanding while showing
substantial improvements on embodied and real-world spatial tasks.

Motivation: 推动真正的多模态智能发展，超越当前反应式、任务驱动的系统和暴力长上下文方法，转向更广泛的空间超感知范式。

Method: 提出空间超感知的四个阶段框架，开发VSI-SUPER基准测试（包含VSR和VSC任务），训练Cambrian-S模型，并引入基于预测误差的自监督下一潜在帧预测器方法。

Result: 在VSI-Bench上获得+30%的绝对改进，但在VSI-SUPER上表现仍然有限。预测性感知方法在VSI-SUPER上显著优于领先的专有基线模型。

Conclusion: 仅靠规模扩展不足以实现空间超感知，需要能够预见、选择和组织经验的模型，预测性感知是实现空间超感知的有效路径。

Abstract: We argue that progress in true multimodal intelligence calls for a shift from
reactive, task-driven systems and brute-force long context towards a broader
paradigm of supersensing. We frame spatial supersensing as four stages beyond
linguistic-only understanding: semantic perception (naming what is seen),
streaming event cognition (maintaining memory across continuous experiences),
implicit 3D spatial cognition (inferring the world behind pixels), and
predictive world modeling (creating internal models that filter and organize
information). Current benchmarks largely test only the early stages, offering
narrow coverage of spatial cognition and rarely challenging models in ways that
require true world modeling. To drive progress in spatial supersensing, we
present VSI-SUPER, a two-part benchmark: VSR (long-horizon visual spatial
recall) and VSC (continual visual spatial counting). These tasks require
arbitrarily long video inputs yet are resistant to brute-force context
expansion. We then test data scaling limits by curating VSI-590K and training
Cambrian-S, achieving +30% absolute improvement on VSI-Bench without
sacrificing general capabilities. Yet performance on VSI-SUPER remains limited,
indicating that scale alone is insufficient for spatial supersensing. We
propose predictive sensing as a path forward, presenting a proof-of-concept in
which a self-supervised next-latent-frame predictor leverages surprise
(prediction error) to drive memory and event segmentation. On VSI-SUPER, this
approach substantially outperforms leading proprietary baselines, showing that
spatial supersensing requires models that not only see but also anticipate,
select, and organize experience.

Motivation: 基于自回归建模在视觉和语言领域的成功，开发一个统一的框架来同时捕捉空间和时间依赖关系，支持多种生成任务。

Method: 采用纯离散方法，在单一架构中联合捕捉空间和时间依赖关系，通过直接的时间自回归支持文本到图像、文本到视频、图像到视频和长交互视频合成。

Conclusion: InfinityStar是第一个能够生成工业级720p视频的离散自回归视频生成器，为高效、高质量视频生成研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: We introduce InfinityStar, a unified spacetime autoregressive framework for
high-resolution image and dynamic video synthesis. Building on the recent
success of autoregressive modeling in both vision and language, our purely
discrete approach jointly captures spatial and temporal dependencies within a
single architecture. This unified design naturally supports a variety of
generation tasks such as text-to-image, text-to-video, image-to-video, and long
interactive video synthesis via straightforward temporal autoregression.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that InfinityStar scores 83.74 on VBench,
outperforming all autoregressive models by large margins, even surpassing some
diffusion competitors like HunyuanVideo. Without extra optimizations, our model
generates a 5s, 720p video approximately 10x faster than leading
diffusion-based methods. To our knowledge, InfinityStar is the first discrete
autoregressive video generator capable of producing industrial level 720p
videos. We release all code and models to foster further research in efficient,
high-quality video generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的物体经常发生状态转换，现有方法在物体外观发生显著变化时往往会丢失跟踪目标，这限制了对物体动态变化的理解。

Method: TubeletGraph系统首先识别可能被忽略的跟踪轨迹，基于语义和邻近性先验决定是否整合这些轨迹，然后推理添加的轨迹并生成描述每个观察到的转换的状态图。

Result: TubeletGraph在状态转换下的跟踪性能达到最先进水平，同时展示了对物体转换的更深层次理解，以及在复杂物体转换的时间定位和语义推理方面的有前景能力。

Conclusion: 该工作通过引入新的基准数据集VOST-TAS和TubeletGraph系统，成功解决了物体在状态转换过程中的跟踪问题，为理解现实世界物体动态提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Real-world objects frequently undergo state transformations. From an apple
being cut into pieces to a butterfly emerging from its cocoon, tracking through
these changes is important for understanding real-world objects and dynamics.
However, existing methods often lose track of the target object after
transformation, due to significant changes in object appearance. To address
this limitation, we introduce the task of Track Any State: tracking objects
through transformations while detecting and describing state changes,
accompanied by a new benchmark dataset, VOST-TAS. To tackle this problem, we
present TubeletGraph, a zero-shot system that recovers missing objects after
transformation and maps out how object states are evolving over time.
TubeletGraph first identifies potentially overlooked tracks, and determines
whether they should be integrated based on semantic and proximity priors. Then,
it reasons about the added tracks and generates a state graph describing each
observed transformation. TubeletGraph achieves state-of-the-art tracking
performance under transformations, while demonstrating deeper understanding of
object transformations and promising capabilities in temporal grounding and
semantic reasoning for complex object transformations. Code, additional
results, and the benchmark dataset are available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新方法，通过提取大语言模型中的隐藏状态激活，基于大五人格特质构建低秩子空间，实现对模型人格特质的精确控制和引导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在生成内容时表现出隐含的人格特质，但如何可靠地控制或对齐这些特质以满足特定需求仍是一个开放挑战。需要开发有效的机制来在生成过程中操纵模型行为。

Method: 提出了一种新流程：从transformer层提取隐藏状态激活，使用大五人格特质框架，应用低秩子空间发现方法，识别不同模型架构中特质特定的最优层进行鲁棒注入，并通过动态层选择的灵活引导框架实现人格对齐方向的运作。

Result: 研究发现人格特质占据低秩共享子空间，这些潜在结构可以通过精心设计的扰动转化为有效的引导机制，而不影响流畅性、方差和一般能力。

Conclusion: 该方法有助于弥合心理学理论与实际模型对齐之间的差距，为人格感知的大语言模型提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models exhibit implicit personalities in their generation, but
reliably controlling or aligning these traits to meet specific needs remains an
open challenge. The need for effective mechanisms for behavioural manipulation
of the model during generation is a critical gap in the literature that needs
to be fulfilled. Personality-aware LLMs hold a promising direction towards this
objective. However, the relationship between these psychological constructs and
their representations within LLMs remains underexplored and requires further
investigation. Moreover, it is intriguing to understand and study the use of
these representations to steer the models' behaviour. We propose a novel
pipeline that extracts hidden state activations from transformer layers using
the Big Five Personality Traits (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion,
Agreeableness and Neuroticism), which is a comprehensive and empirically
validated framework to model human personality applies low-rank subspace
discovery methods, and identifies trait-specific optimal layers across
different model architectures for robust injection. The resulting
personality-aligned directions are then operationalised through a flexible
steering framework with dynamic layer selection, enabling precise control of
trait expression in LLM outputs. Our findings reveal that personality traits
occupy a low-rank shared subspace, and that these latent structures can be
transformed into actionable mechanisms for effective steering through careful
perturbations without impacting the fluency, variance and general capabilities,
helping to bridge the gap between psychological theory and practical model
alignment.

Conclusion: TextualVerifier是首个基于大语言模型为TextGrad提供自我验证的框架，无需数值梯度即可实现更可靠的推理，为文本优化中的验证开辟了新方向。

Abstract: TextGrad is a novel approach to text-based automatic differentiation that
enables composite AI systems to perform optimization without explicit numerical
equations. However, it currently lacks self-verification mechanisms that ensure
reasoning validity in text-based decision making. This research introduces
TextualVerifier, a verification framework that leverages chain-of-thought
reasoning and majority voting with large language models to address this
verification gap. TextualVerifier implements a four-stage workflow:
chain-of-thought decomposition, variant generation, majority voting, and
consensus aggregation. It integrates non-invasively with TextGrad at both the
loss function and optimization result verification stages. Experimental
evaluation using the Gemini 1.5 Pro model is conducted in two phases: (1)
standalone evaluation on PRM800K, and (2) integrated evaluation with TextGrad
on GPQA-Diamond, MMLU-ML, and MMLU-CP benchmarks. Results show statistically
significant improvements (p < 0.001). In phase one, TextualVerifier improves
the validity of reasoning steps by 29 percent. In phase two, integration into
TextGrad loss function yields a 2.2 percentage point gain from 68.2 to 70.4
percent with a moderate overhead of 5.9 LLM calls on average. Further
evaluations of TextualVerifier versioning yield 8.08, 10.71, and 3.92
percentage point improvements on GPQA, MMLU-ML, and MMLU-CP respectively.
TextualVerifier thus presents the first self-verification framework for
TextGrad through LLM-based techniques without requiring numerical gradients,
enabling more reliable reasoning and opening new directions for verification in
text-based optimization.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) play a central role in modern artificial
intelligence, yet their development has been primarily focused on English,
resulting in limited support for other languages. We present PLLuM (Polish
Large Language Model), the largest open-source family of foundation models
tailored specifically for the Polish language. Developed by a consortium of
major Polish research institutions, PLLuM addresses the need for high-quality,

commercial landscape. We describe the development process, including the
construction of a new 140-billion-token Polish text corpus for pre-training, a
77k custom instructions dataset, and a 100k preference optimization dataset. A
key component is a Responsible AI framework that incorporates strict data
governance and a hybrid module for output correction and safety filtering. We
detail the models' architecture, training procedures, and alignment techniques
for both base and instruction-tuned variants, and demonstrate their utility in
a downstream task within public administration. By releasing these models

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: STARS是一种解码时算法，通过迭代采样、评分和拒绝/接受固定大小的短令牌段来引导模型生成，显著提高计算效率和对齐质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型对齐方法如微调计算成本高且效果不佳，而推理时方法如Best-of-N采样需要不切实际的计算量才能达到最优对齐。

Method: STARS采用分段级令牌对齐与拒绝采样，在解码时对短固定大小的令牌段进行迭代采样、评分和拒绝/接受，实现生成路径的早期修正。

Result: 在六个LLM上的实验表明，STARS在胜率上比监督微调高出14.9个百分点，比直接偏好优化高出4.3个百分点，同时与强Best-of-N基线保持高度竞争力。

Conclusion: 细粒度、奖励引导的采样是传统微调和全序列排序方法的通用、鲁棒且高效替代方案，用于对齐大语言模型。

Abstract: Aligning large language models with human values is crucial for their safe
deployment; however, existing methods, such as fine-tuning, are computationally
expensive and suboptimal. In contrast, inference-time approaches like Best-of-N
sampling require practically infeasible computation to achieve optimal
alignment. We propose STARS: Segment-level Token Alignment with Rejection
Sampling, a decoding-time algorithm that steers model generation by iteratively
sampling, scoring, and rejecting/accepting short, fixed-size token segments.
This allows for early correction of the generation path, significantly
improving computational efficiency and boosting alignment quality. Across a
suite of six LLMs, we show that STARS outperforms Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)
by up to 14.9 percentage points and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) by up
to 4.3 percentage points on win-rates, while remaining highly competitive with
strong Best-of-N baselines. Our work establishes granular, reward-guided
sampling as a generalizable, robust, and efficient alternative to traditional
fine-tuning and full-sequence ranking methods for aligning LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在多标签分类任务中的效率问题，特别是短文本推理时的计算开销，同时保持分类准确性。

Method: 将多标签分类重构为二分决策序列，每个目标维度独立查询；采用LLM-to-SLM蒸馏方法，使用DeepSeek-V3生成标注数据来微调较小模型；结合前缀缓存机制优化推理效率。

Result: 微调后的模型在情感文本分析的24个维度上显著优于零样本基线，特别是在训练过程中见过的维度上表现更好。

Conclusion: 将多标签分类分解为二分查询，结合蒸馏和缓存感知推理，为基于LLM的分类提供了一个可扩展且有效的框架，该方法具有通用性，可应用于其他领域。

Abstract: We introduce a method for efficient multi-label text classification with
large language models (LLMs), built on reformulating classification tasks as
sequences of dichotomic (yes/no) decisions. Instead of generating all labels in
a single structured response, each target dimension is queried independently,
which, combined with a prefix caching mechanism, yields substantial efficiency
gains for short-text inference without loss of accuracy. To demonstrate the
approach, we focus on affective text analysis, covering 24 dimensions including
emotions and sentiment. Using LLM-to-SLM distillation, a powerful annotator
model (DeepSeek-V3) provides multiple annotations per text, which are
aggregated to fine-tune smaller models (HerBERT-Large, CLARIN-1B, PLLuM-8B,
Gemma3-1B). The fine-tuned models show significant improvements over zero-shot
baselines, particularly on the dimensions seen during training. Our findings
suggest that decomposing multi-label classification into dichotomic queries,
combined with distillation and cache-aware inference, offers a scalable and
effective framework for LLM-based classification. While we validate the method
on affective states, the approach is general and applicable across domains.

TL;DR: 本文研究了三种低资源语言（阿法尔奥罗莫语、阿姆哈拉语和提格里尼亚语）机器翻译数据集的质量问题，重点关注性别代表性，发现数据集存在严重的性别偏见和有害内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着低资源语言被纳入NLP研究，大规模数据集的收集往往重数量轻质量，这可能导致技术性能差和产生有害内容，因此需要调查这些数据集的质量问题。

Method: 通过分析三种低资源语言的机器翻译数据集，特别关注性别代表性，包括人名、动词的语法性别和刻板印象描绘等方面。

Result: 研究发现训练数据中政治和宗教领域文本占主导，而基准数据集集中在新闻、健康、体育领域；数据集存在严重的男性偏向，包括人名、动词性别和刻板印象；还发现了针对女性的有害和毒性描绘，数据量最大的语言问题最严重。

Conclusion: 数据量不能保证质量，需要进一步调查低资源语言数据集并及早缓解有害内容。

Abstract: As low-resourced languages are increasingly incorporated into NLP research,
there is an emphasis on collecting large-scale datasets. But in prioritizing
quantity over quality, we risk 1) building language technologies that perform
poorly for these languages and 2) producing harmful content that perpetuates
societal biases. In this paper, we investigate the quality of Machine
Translation (MT) datasets for three low-resourced languages--Afan Oromo,
Amharic, and Tigrinya, with a focus on the gender representation in the
datasets. Our findings demonstrate that while training data has a large
representation of political and religious domain text, benchmark datasets are
focused on news, health, and sports. We also found a large skew towards the
male gender--in names of persons, the grammatical gender of verbs, and in
stereotypical depictions in the datasets. Further, we found harmful and toxic
depictions against women, which were more prominent for the language with the
largest amount of data, underscoring that quantity does not guarantee quality.
We hope that our work inspires further inquiry into the datasets collected for
low-resourced languages and prompts early mitigation of harmful content.

Motivation: 现有表格推理基准测试主要针对小型、统一的表格，未能充分反映真实世界数据的复杂性，无法全面评估大型语言模型的推理能力。真实表格通常很长、异构且领域特定，需要跨数千个标记的多跳推理。

Method: 引入RUST-BENCH基准测试，包含7966个问题，来自2031个真实世界表格，涵盖两个领域：RB-Science（NSF资助记录）和RB-Sports（NBA统计数据）。该基准测试联合评估LLM在规模、异构性、领域特定性和推理复杂性方面的表现。

Result: 开源和专有模型的实验表明，LLM在处理异构模式和复杂多跳推理方面存在困难，揭示了当前架构和提示策略的持续弱点。

Conclusion: RUST-BENCH为推进表格推理研究建立了一个具有挑战性的新测试平台。

Abstract: Existing tabular reasoning benchmarks mostly test models on small, uniform
tables, underrepresenting the complexity of real-world data and giving an
incomplete view of Large Language Models' (LLMs) reasoning abilities. Real
tables are long, heterogeneous, and domain-specific, mixing structured fields
with free text and requiring multi-hop reasoning across thousands of tokens. To
address this gap, we introduce RUST-BENCH, a benchmark of 7966 questions from
2031 real-world tables spanning two domains: i) RB-Science (NSF grant records)
and ii) RB-Sports (NBA statistics). Unlike prior work, RUST-BENCH evaluates
LLMs jointly across scale, heterogeneity, domain specificity, and reasoning
complexity. Experiments with open-source and proprietary models show that LLMs
struggle with heterogeneous schemas and complex multi-hop inference, revealing
persistent weaknesses in current architectures and prompting strategies.
RUST-BENCH establishes a challenging new testbed for advancing tabular
reasoning research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖外部知识源，但基于提示的接地方法脆弱且领域敏感，符号知识集成成本高昂。受知识图谱启发，希望开发轻量级方法在解码时利用语料证据。

Method: GRAD通过单次前向传播在检索语料上累积下一令牌对数构建稀疏令牌转移图，解码时对图检索的对数进行最大归一化并与模型对数自适应融合，优先选择高证据延续。

Result: 在三个模型和多个问答基准测试中，GRAD始终优于基线方法，内在准确率提高9.7%，幻觉率降低8.6%，正确性提高6.9%，在所有方法中获得最高的真实性-信息性乘积分数。

Conclusion: GRAD提供了一种轻量级即插即用替代方案，证明语料级令牌转移的统计证据可以有效引导生成更真实可验证的输出。

Abstract: Hallucination mitigation remains a persistent challenge for large language
models (LLMs), even as model scales grow. Existing approaches often rely on
external knowledge sources, such as structured databases or knowledge graphs,
accessed through prompting or retrieval. However, prompt-based grounding is
fragile and domain-sensitive, while symbolic knowledge integration incurs heavy
retrieval and formatting costs. Motivated by knowledge graphs, we introduce
Graph-Retrieved Adaptive Decoding (GRAD), a decoding-time method that grounds
generation in corpus-derived evidence without retraining. GRAD constructs a
sparse token transition graph by accumulating next-token logits across a small
retrieved corpus in a single forward pass. During decoding, graph-retrieved
logits are max-normalized and adaptively fused with model logits to favor
high-evidence continuations while preserving fluency. Across three models and a
range of question-answering benchmarks spanning intrinsic, extrinsic
hallucination, and factuality tasks, GRAD consistently surpasses baselines,
achieving up to 9.7$\%$ higher intrinsic accuracy, 8.6$\%$ lower hallucination
rates, and 6.9$\%$ greater correctness compared to greedy decoding, while
attaining the highest truth--informativeness product score among all methods.
GRAD offers a lightweight, plug-and-play alternative to contrastive decoding
and knowledge graph augmentation, demonstrating that statistical evidence from
corpus-level token transitions can effectively steer generation toward more
truthful and verifiable outputs.

Motivation: 探索智能体在多轮语言环境中进行上下文敏感语用推理的能力，通过迭代参考游戏测试人类和机器模型的表现差异。

Method: 使用迭代参考游戏测试人类和视觉语言模型，通过改变上下文的数量、顺序和相关性来评估性能。

Result: 在没有相关上下文时，模型表现优于随机但显著差于人类；有相关上下文时，模型性能随试验次数显著提升；抽象指称的少样本参考游戏对机器学习模型仍是挑战。

Conclusion: 上下文相关性对模型性能有重要影响，相关上下文能显著提升模型表现，但抽象指称的少样本参考游戏仍是机器学习模型的难点。

Abstract: Iterated reference games - in which players repeatedly pick out novel
referents using language - present a test case for agents' ability to perform
context-sensitive pragmatic reasoning in multi-turn linguistic environments. We
tested humans and vision-language models on trials from iterated reference
games, varying the given context in terms of amount, order, and relevance.
Without relevant context, models were above chance but substantially worse than
humans. However, with relevant context, model performance increased
dramatically over trials. Few-shot reference games with abstract referents
remain a difficult task for machine learning models.

Abstract: Quantifying human flourishing, a multidimensional construct including
happiness, health, purpose, virtue, relationships, and financial stability, is
critical for understanding societal well-being beyond economic indicators.
Existing measures often lack fine spatial and temporal resolution. Here we
introduce the Human Flourishing Geographic Index (HFGI), derived from analyzing
approximately 2.6 billion geolocated U.S. tweets (2013-2023) using fine-tuned
large language models to classify expressions across 48 indicators aligned with
Harvard's Global Flourishing Study framework plus attitudes towards migration
and perception of corruption. The dataset offers monthly and yearly county- and
state-level indicators of flourishing-related discourse, validated to confirm
that the measures accurately represent the underlying constructs and show
expected correlations with established indicators. This resource enables
multidisciplinary analyses of well-being, inequality, and social change at

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种通过向量翻译在多智能体系统中实现潜在语义直接交换的方法，替代传统的基于token的消息传递方式，减少计算开销并提升信息传输效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多智能体设置中，传统方法使用纯token传递消息，丢弃了大部分潜在语义，这限制了信息传输并增加了不必要的计算开销。

Method: 通过向量翻译形成潜在桥梁，使用学习到的映射在表示空间之间实现直接语义交换。训练了Llama-2-7B和Mistral-7B-Instruct之间的双编码器翻译器。

Result: 翻译器达到平均余弦对齐度0.538，以30%混合强度注入翻译向量可以引导目标模型生成而不破坏对数概率。双向评估显示2.01:1的传输不对称性。

Conclusion: 这种保守的注入方法保持了计算稳定性，证明跨模型潜在通信是可行的，使协作AI系统能够共享意义而非token。

Abstract: In multi-agent settings, such as debate, reflection, or tool-calling, large
language models (LLMs) pass messages as plain tokens, discarding most latent
semantics. This constrains information transfer and adds unnecessary
computational overhead. We form a latent bridge via vector translations, which
use learned mappings that enable direct semantic exchange between
representation spaces. A dual-encoder translator trained between Llama-2-7B and
Mistral-7B-Instruct attains an average cosine alignment of 0.538. Injecting the
translated vectors at 30 percent blending strength steers the target model's
generation without destabilizing logits. Bidirectional evaluation shows a
2.01:1 transfer asymmetry, indicating that general-purpose models yield more
transferable representations than instruction-tuned variants. This conservative
injection preserves computational stability while demonstrating that
cross-model latent communication is feasible, enabling collaborative AI systems
that share meaning rather than tokens.

Motivation: RAG管道在检索证据不完整时经常失败，导致推理过程中存在空白。溯因推理作为一种填补这些空白的原理性方法，可以增强RAG系统的鲁棒性和可解释性。

Method: 提出一个集成溯因推理的框架，包括检测证据不足、生成候选缺失前提，并通过一致性和合理性检查进行验证。

Result: 在溯因推理和多跳问答基准测试上的实验结果表明，该方法提高了答案准确性和推理忠实度。

Conclusion: 溯因推理是增强RAG系统鲁棒性和可解释性的有前景方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enhanced with retrieval -- commonly referred to
as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) -- have demonstrated strong performance
in knowledge-intensive tasks. However, RAG pipelines often fail when retrieved
evidence is incomplete, leaving gaps in the reasoning process. In such cases,
\emph{abductive inference} -- the process of generating plausible missing
premises to explain observations -- offers a principled approach to bridge
these gaps. In this paper, we propose a framework that integrates abductive
inference into retrieval-augmented LLMs. Our method detects insufficient
evidence, generates candidate missing premises, and validates them through
consistency and plausibility checks. Experimental results on abductive
reasoning and multi-hop QA benchmarks show that our approach improves both
answer accuracy and reasoning faithfulness. This work highlights abductive
inference as a promising direction for enhancing the robustness and
explainability of RAG systems.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了T-FIX基准，用于评估LLM在知识密集型领域生成的解释与专家直觉的对齐程度，强调当前评估方法主要关注解释的合理性和内部一致性，而忽视了与专家推理的对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在知识密集型领域（如手术、天文学、治疗）的应用，用户（通常是领域专家）不仅需要答案，还需要反映专家级推理的有意义解释。当前评估方法主要关注解释的合理性和内部一致性，无法捕捉解释内容是否真正符合专家直觉。

Method: 与领域专家合作开发了T-FIX基准，涵盖七个知识密集型领域，并设计了新的指标来衡量LLM解释与专家判断的对齐程度。

Result: 提出了专家对齐作为评估解释的新标准，并开发了相应的评估基准和指标。

Conclusion: 需要新的评估框架来确保LLM在知识密集型领域生成的解释能够真正与专家推理保持一致，T-FIX基准为此提供了解决方案。

Abstract: As LLMs are deployed in knowledge-intensive settings (e.g., surgery,
astronomy, therapy), users expect not just answers, but also meaningful
explanations for those answers. In these settings, users are often domain
experts (e.g., doctors, astrophysicists, psychologists) who require
explanations that reflect expert-level reasoning. However, current evaluation
schemes primarily emphasize plausibility or internal faithfulness of the
explanation, which fail to capture whether the content of the explanation truly
aligns with expert intuition. We formalize expert alignment as a criterion for
evaluating explanations with T-FIX, a benchmark spanning seven
knowledge-intensive domains. In collaboration with domain experts, we develop
novel metrics to measure the alignment of LLM explanations with expert
judgment.

Method: 提出知识规划模块将复杂时序问题分解为子目标序列，构建时序知识存储库和对比检索框架，选择性检索语义和时间对齐的事实。

Result: 在四个基准TKGQA数据集上的实验表明，PoK显著提升了大语言模型的检索精度和推理准确性，最多超越最先进方法56.0%。

Conclusion: 通过结合结构化规划和时序知识检索，PoK有效增强了时序推理的可解释性和事实一致性，解决了大语言模型在时序推理中的局限性。

Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graph Question Answering (TKGQA) aims to answer
time-sensitive questions by leveraging factual information from Temporal
Knowledge Graphs (TKGs). While previous studies have employed pre-trained TKG
embeddings or graph neural networks to inject temporal knowledge, they fail to
fully understand the complex semantic information of time constraints.
Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress,
benefiting from their strong semantic understanding and reasoning
generalization capabilities. However, their temporal reasoning ability remains
limited. LLMs frequently suffer from hallucination and a lack of knowledge. To
address these limitations, we propose the Plan of Knowledge framework with a
contrastive temporal retriever, which is named PoK. Specifically, the proposed
Plan of Knowledge module decomposes a complex temporal question into a sequence
of sub-objectives from the pre-defined tools, serving as intermediate guidance
for reasoning exploration. In parallel, we construct a Temporal Knowledge Store
(TKS) with a contrastive retrieval framework, enabling the model to selectively
retrieve semantically and temporally aligned facts from TKGs. By combining
structured planning with temporal knowledge retrieval, PoK effectively enhances
the interpretability and factual consistency of temporal reasoning. Extensive
experiments on four benchmark TKGQA datasets demonstrate that PoK significantly
improves the retrieval precision and reasoning accuracy of LLMs, surpassing the
performance of the state-of-the-art TKGQA methods by 56.0% at most.

TL;DR: 本文比较了人类与大型语言模型在词汇联想行为上的差异，特别是对情感词汇的联想反应。研究发现LLMs与人类的联想重叠度中等，但LLMs倾向于放大刺激词的情感负荷，且联想更为可预测和缺乏创造性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类词汇联想是研究心理词典的重要方法，但人类反应受个人经验、情感和认知风格影响，难以预测。本研究旨在探索大型语言模型是否能以类似人类的方式生成联想，特别是对情感词汇的联想。

Method: 通过比较人类与大型语言模型对情感词汇的联想行为，分析两者在联想反应上的相似性和差异。

Result: 研究发现人类与LLMs的联想重叠度中等，但LLMs倾向于放大刺激词的情感负荷，其联想更为可预测且缺乏人类联想的创造性。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在词汇联想方面与人类存在显著差异，其联想行为更加可预测且缺乏创造性，同时会放大情感词汇的情感负荷。

Abstract: Human word associations are a well-known method of gaining insight into the
internal mental lexicon, but the responses spontaneously offered by human
participants to word cues are not always predictable as they may be influenced
by personal experience, emotions or individual cognitive styles. The ability to
form associative links between seemingly unrelated concepts can be the driving
mechanisms of creativity. We perform a comparison of the associative behaviour
of humans compared to large language models. More specifically, we explore
associations to emotionally loaded words and try to determine whether large
language models generate associations in a similar way to humans. We find that
the overlap between humans and LLMs is moderate, but also that the associations
of LLMs tend to amplify the underlying emotional load of the stimulus, and that
they tend to be more predictable and less creative than human ones.

TL;DR: 基于Transformer的模型通过大规模多模态训练，在放射学报告的去标识化任务中超越了现有学术和商业系统，实现了跨机构的泛化能力和鲁棒性提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升放射学报告的自动化去标识化能力，通过扩展训练数据集和基准测试来改进受保护健康信息(PHI)检测性能。

Method: 在现有最先进的Transformer-based PHI去标识化流水线基础上，使用斯坦福大学两个大型注释放射学语料库进行微调，引入新的PHI类别(AGE)，并评估模型在斯坦福和宾夕法尼亚大学测试集上的表现。

Result: 模型在宾夕法尼亚数据集上获得0.973的总体F1分数，在斯坦福数据集上获得0.996的F1分数，优于或保持了先前最先进模型的性能。在合成PHI评估中，模型在所有供应商系统中表现最佳。

Conclusion: 基于Transformer的去标识化模型在多样化的放射学数据集上训练后，在PHI检测方面超越了先前的学术和商业系统，为安全的临床文本处理建立了新的基准。

Abstract: Objective: To enhance automated de-identification of radiology reports by
scaling transformer-based models through extensive training datasets and
benchmarking performance against commercial cloud vendor systems for protected
health information (PHI) detection. Materials and Methods: In this
retrospective study, we built upon a state-of-the-art, transformer-based, PHI
de-identification pipeline by fine-tuning on two large annotated radiology
corpora from Stanford University, encompassing chest X-ray, chest CT,
abdomen/pelvis CT, and brain MR reports and introducing an additional PHI
category (AGE) into the architecture. Model performance was evaluated on test
sets from Stanford and the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) for token-level
PHI detection. We further assessed (1) the stability of synthetic PHI
generation using a "hide-in-plain-sight" method and (2) performance against
commercial systems. Precision, recall, and F1 scores were computed across all
PHI categories. Results: Our model achieved overall F1 scores of 0.973 on the
Penn dataset and 0.996 on the Stanford dataset, outperforming or maintaining
the previous state-of-the-art model performance. Synthetic PHI evaluation
showed consistent detectability (overall F1: 0.959 [0.958-0.960]) across 50
independently de-identified Penn datasets. Our model outperformed all vendor
systems on synthetic Penn reports (overall F1: 0.960 vs. 0.632-0.754).
Discussion: Large-scale, multimodal training improved cross-institutional
generalization and robustness. Synthetic PHI generation preserved data utility
while ensuring privacy. Conclusion: A transformer-based de-identification model
trained on diverse radiology datasets outperforms prior academic and commercial
systems in PHI detection and establishes a new benchmark for secure clinical
text processing.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究语言识别的k列表识别问题，给出了k列表识别的精确特征描述，并将其与统计学习中的识别率联系起来。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典的语言识别在极限中是不可能的，但最近在语言生成方面的积极结果促使重新审视这个问题，考虑学习者每次输出k个猜测的情况。

Method: 基于Angluin的经典特征描述，提出了递归版本的特征描述方法，将k列表识别问题分解为k个可识别语言集合的并集。

Result: 给出了k列表识别的精确特征描述：一个语言集合可以k列表识别当且仅当它可以分解为k个可识别语言集合的并集。在统计设置中，可k列表识别的集合可以以指数速率识别，而不可识别的集合则无法以任何趋于零的速率识别。

Conclusion: 该研究扩展了经典语言识别理论，为k列表识别提供了完整的理论框架，并在统计学习背景下建立了识别率的下界和上界。

Abstract: We study the problem of language identification in the limit, where given a
sequence of examples from a target language, the goal of the learner is to
output a sequence of guesses for the target language such that all the guesses
beyond some finite time are correct. Classical results of Gold showed that
language identification in the limit is impossible for essentially any
interesting collection of languages. Later, Angluin gave a precise
characterization of language collections for which this task is possible.
Motivated by recent positive results for the related problem of language
generation, we revisit the classic language identification problem in the
setting where the learner is given the additional power of producing a list of
$k$ guesses at each time step. The goal is to ensure that beyond some finite
time, one of the guesses is correct at each time step.
  We give an exact characterization of collections of languages that can be
$k$-list identified in the limit, based on a recursive version of Angluin's
characterization (for language identification with a list of size $1$). This
further leads to a conceptually appealing characterization: A language
collection can be $k$-list identified in the limit if and only if the
collection can be decomposed into $k$ collections of languages, each of which
can be identified in the limit (with a list of size $1$). We also use our
characterization to establish rates for list identification in the statistical
setting where the input is drawn as an i.i.d. stream from a distribution
supported on some language in the collection. Our results show that if a
collection is $k$-list identifiable in the limit, then the collection can be
$k$-list identified at an exponential rate, and this is best possible. On the
other hand, if a collection is not $k$-list identifiable in the limit, then it
cannot be $k$-list identified at any rate that goes to zero.

TL;DR: 批处理提示不仅降低了大型语言模型的推理成本，还能在推理过程中起到正则化作用，提高准确性并大幅减少推理token使用量（通常3-5倍），同时抑制过度思考、减少犹豫语言，并促进更果断的答案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索批处理提示在大型推理模型中的额外价值，发现其作为推理时正则化器的潜力，而不仅仅是吞吐量优化手段。

Method: 在13个多样化基准测试上进行全面研究，通过详细的行为分析观察批处理对模型推理行为的影响。

Result: 批处理提高了准确性，大幅减少了推理token使用量（3-5倍），抑制了过度思考，减少了犹豫语言，并出现了集体效应：模型能够从批次中较早的例子中泛化模式来解决更难的问题。

Conclusion: 批处理不仅是吞吐量优化工具，更是一种强大的推理时正则化器，能够实现更高效可靠的LLM推理。

Abstract: Recent work has explored batch prompting as a strategy to amortize inference
cost in large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we show that batching
offers an additional, underappreciated benefit: it regularizes model behavior
during multi-step reasoning for Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). We conduct a
comprehensive study across 13 diverse benchmarks and observe that batching
improves accuracy while substantially reducing reasoning token usage, often by
3x-5x. Through detailed behavioral analysis, we find that batching suppresses
overthinking, reduces hedging language (e.g., repetitive self-corrections), and
encourages more decisive answers. Surprisingly, we also observe emergent
collective effects in batched inference: models often generalize patterns from
earlier examples to solve harder ones in the same batch. These findings
position batching not just as a throughput optimization, but as a powerful
inference-time regularizer for more efficient and reliable LLM reasoning.

TL;DR: RIDE是一个基于项目反应理论的对抗性数学问题重写框架，通过生成内在更困难的数学问题变体来评估LLMs的真实数学推理能力，避免训练数据泄露的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于规则的扰动方法常常生成不恰当的问题，阻碍了系统评估问题难度和基准测试的演进，需要更严谨的方法来测量真实的数学推理能力。

Method: 使用35个LLMs模拟学生，基于其响应构建难度排序器，在强化学习中提供奖励信号，指导问题重写模型在不同难度级别上重新表述现有问题。

Result: 在竞赛级数学基准测试中，RIDE生成的扰动版本使先进LLMs性能平均下降21.73%（26个模型），暴露了数学推理的有限鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RIDE框架有效验证了评估方法的有效性，揭示了LLMs在数学推理方面的鲁棒性限制。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve high performance on mathematical
reasoning, but these results can be inflated by training data leakage or
superficial pattern matching rather than genuine reasoning. To this end, an
adversarial perturbation-based evaluation is needed to measure true
mathematical reasoning ability. Current rule-based perturbation methods often
generate ill-posed questions and impede the systematic evaluation of question
difficulty and the evolution of benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we propose
RIDE, a novel adversarial question-rewriting framework that leverages Item
Response Theory (IRT) to rigorously measure question difficulty and to generate
intrinsically more challenging, well-posed variations of mathematical problems.
We employ 35 LLMs to simulate students and build a difficulty ranker from their
responses. This ranker provides a reward signal during reinforcement learning
and guides a question-rewriting model to reformulate existing questions across
difficulty levels. Applying RIDE to competition-level mathematical benchmarks
yields perturbed versions that degrade advanced LLM performance, with
experiments showing an average 21.73% drop across 26 models, thereby exposing
limited robustness in mathematical reasoning and confirming the validity of our
evaluation approach.

TL;DR: CantoASR是一个协作式ASR-LALM错误校正框架，通过整合强制对齐、LoRA微调Whisper和指令调优Qwen-Audio，显著提升了低资源粤语语音识别的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 粤语ASR面临标注数据有限、六种声调、变调和口音变化等挑战，现有模型如Whisper词错误率高，需要结合声调和韵律等声学线索来提升性能。

Method: 提出CantoASR框架：使用强制对齐提取声学特征，LoRA微调Whisper提升声调识别，指令调优Qwen-Audio进行韵律感知校正。

Result: 在自发粤语数据上的评估显示，相比Whisper-Large-V3在CER指标上取得显著提升。

Conclusion: 将声学线索与LALM推理相结合，为低资源声调语言和方言ASR提供了可扩展的策略。

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) is critical for language accessibility,
yet low-resource Cantonese remains challenging due to limited annotated data,
six lexical tones, tone sandhi, and accent variation. Existing ASR models, such
as Whisper, often suffer from high word error rates. Large audio-language
models (LALMs), in contrast, can leverage broader contextual reasoning but
still require explicit tonal and prosodic acoustic cues. We introduce CantoASR,
a collaborative ASR-LALM error correction framework that integrates forced
alignment for acoustic feature extraction, a LoRA-finetuned Whisper for
improved tone discrimination, and an instruction-tuned Qwen-Audio for
prosody-aware correction. Evaluations on spontaneous Cantonese data show
substantial CER gains over Whisper-Large-V3. These findings suggest that
integrating acoustic cues with LALM reasoning provides a scalable strategy for
low-resource tonal and dialectal ASR.

TL;DR: 本文探索了三种多智能体LLM管道用于Text-to-SQL任务，通过系统性能基准测试发现多智能体讨论能提升小模型性能，其中LLM Reasoner-Coder管道效果最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型在从自然语言指令生成SQL时面临模式规模大和复杂推理的挑战，先前工作多关注复杂不实用的旗舰模型管道，而小型高效模型被忽视。

Method: 提出三种多智能体LLM管道：(1)多智能体讨论管道，智能体迭代批判和优化SQL查询，法官合成最终答案；(2)规划器-编码器管道，思考模型规划器生成逐步SQL生成计划，编码器合成查询；(3)编码器-聚合器管道，多个编码器独立生成SQL查询，推理智能体选择最佳查询。

Result: 在Bird-Bench Mini-Dev集上的实验表明，多智能体讨论能提升小模型性能，Qwen2.5-7b-Instruct经过三轮讨论后执行准确率提升10.6%。LLM Reasoner-Coder管道效果最佳，DeepSeek-R1-32B和QwQ-32B规划器将Gemma 3 27B IT准确率从52.4%提升至最高的56.4%。

Conclusion: 多智能体方法能有效提升Text-to-SQL任务中较小模型的性能，其中规划器-编码器管道表现最优，为高效SQL生成提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL systems provide a natural language interface that can enable even
laymen to access information stored in databases. However, existing Large
Language Models (LLM) struggle with SQL generation from natural instructions
due to large schema sizes and complex reasoning. Prior work often focuses on
complex, somewhat impractical pipelines using flagship models, while smaller,
efficient models remain overlooked. In this work, we explore three multi-agent
LLM pipelines, with systematic performance benchmarking across a range of small
to large open-source models: (1) Multi-agent discussion pipeline, where agents
iteratively critique and refine SQL queries, and a judge synthesizes the final
answer; (2) Planner-Coder pipeline, where a thinking model planner generates
stepwise SQL generation plans and a coder synthesizes queries; and (3)
Coder-Aggregator pipeline, where multiple coders independently generate SQL
queries, and a reasoning agent selects the best query. Experiments on the
Bird-Bench Mini-Dev set reveal that Multi-Agent discussion can improve small
model performance, with up to 10.6% increase in Execution Accuracy for
Qwen2.5-7b-Instruct seen after three rounds of discussion. Among the pipelines,
the LLM Reasoner-Coder pipeline yields the best results, with DeepSeek-R1-32B
and QwQ-32B planners boosting Gemma 3 27B IT accuracy from 52.4% to the highest
score of 56.4%. Codes are available at

TL;DR: LAAC提出将LLM作为智能通信中介，通过结构化对话捕获发送者意图，促进真实知识交换，避免AI生成内容的膨胀和压缩循环。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI生成内容泛滥导致通信剧场化，发送者用LLM将简单想法膨胀为冗长内容，接收者用LLM压缩回摘要，双方都不接触真实内容。

Method: 使用多智能体架构，通过结构化对话捕获发送者意图，评估三个信任维度：信息捕获保真度、可重现性和查询响应完整性。

Result: 初步发现存在可测量的信任差距，在部署到高风险通信场景前需要解决这些问题。

Conclusion: LAAC作为通信中介的部署需要系统解决信息保真度、一致性和可靠性等关键信任问题。

Abstract: The proliferation of AI-generated content has created an absurd communication
theater where senders use LLMs to inflate simple ideas into verbose content,
recipients use LLMs to compress them back into summaries, and as a consequence
neither party engage with authentic content. LAAC (LLM as a Communicator)
proposes a paradigm shift - positioning LLMs as intelligent communication
intermediaries that capture the sender's intent through structured dialogue and
facilitate genuine knowledge exchange with recipients. Rather than perpetuating
cycles of AI-generated inflation and compression, LAAC enables authentic
communication across diverse contexts including academic papers, proposals,
professional emails, and cross-platform content generation. However, deploying
LLMs as trusted communication intermediaries raises critical questions about
information fidelity, consistency, and reliability. This position paper
systematically evaluates the trustworthiness requirements for LAAC's deployment
across multiple communication domains. We investigate three fundamental
dimensions: (1) Information Capture Fidelity - accuracy of intent extraction
during sender interviews across different communication types, (2)
Reproducibility - consistency of structured knowledge across multiple
interaction instances, and (3) Query Response Integrity - reliability of
recipient-facing responses without hallucination, source conflation, or
fabrication. Through controlled experiments spanning multiple LAAC use cases,
we assess these trust dimensions using LAAC's multi-agent architecture.
Preliminary findings reveal measurable trust gaps that must be addressed before
LAAC can be reliably deployed in high-stakes communication scenarios.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个计算图灵测试框架来评估LLM生成文本的真实性，并在多个社交媒体平台上系统比较了9个开源LLM的校准策略，发现即使经过校准，LLM输出仍与人类文本有明显区别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前社会科学中广泛使用LLM模拟人类行为，但缺乏对LLM生成文本真实性的可靠验证工具，现有评估方法主要依赖人类判断，不够准确和可靠。

Method: 引入计算图灵测试框架，结合聚合指标（BERT检测性和语义相似度）与可解释语言特征（风格标记和主题模式）；系统比较9个开源LLM在5种校准策略下的表现，包括微调、风格提示和上下文检索。

Result: 即使经过校准，LLM输出仍与人类文本明显可区分，特别是在情感基调和情绪表达方面；指令调优模型表现不如基础模型；模型规模扩大不会增强人类相似性；存在权衡：优化人类相似性会牺牲语义保真度，反之亦然。

Conclusion: 研究为LLM模拟提供了可扩展的验证和校准框架，同时警示当前LLM在捕捉人类交流方面存在局限性，挑战了文献中的核心假设。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in the social sciences to
simulate human behavior, based on the assumption that they can generate
realistic, human-like text. Yet this assumption remains largely untested.
Existing validation efforts rely heavily on human-judgment-based evaluations --
testing whether humans can distinguish AI from human output -- despite evidence
that such judgments are blunt and unreliable. As a result, the field lacks
robust tools for assessing the realism of LLM-generated text or for calibrating
models to real-world data. This paper makes two contributions. First, we
introduce a computational Turing test: a validation framework that integrates
aggregate metrics (BERT-based detectability and semantic similarity) with
interpretable linguistic features (stylistic markers and topical patterns) to
assess how closely LLMs approximate human language within a given dataset.
Second, we systematically compare nine open-weight LLMs across five calibration
strategies -- including fine-tuning, stylistic prompting, and context retrieval
-- benchmarking their ability to reproduce user interactions on X (formerly
Twitter), Bluesky, and Reddit. Our findings challenge core assumptions in the
literature. Even after calibration, LLM outputs remain clearly distinguishable
from human text, particularly in affective tone and emotional expression.
Instruction-tuned models underperform their base counterparts, and scaling up
model size does not enhance human-likeness. Crucially, we identify a trade-off:
optimizing for human-likeness often comes at the cost of semantic fidelity, and
vice versa. These results provide a much-needed scalable framework for
validation and calibration in LLM simulations -- and offer a cautionary note
about their current limitations in capturing human communication.

Abstract: This study provides an empirical assessment of whether current large language
models (LLMs) can pass the official qualifying examination for membership in
Poland's National Appeal Chamber (Krajowa Izba Odwo{\l}awcza). The authors
examine two related ideas: using LLM as actual exam candidates and applying the
'LLM-as-a-judge' approach, in which model-generated answers are automatically
evaluated by other models. The paper describes the structure of the exam, which
includes a multiple-choice knowledge test on public procurement law and a
written judgment, and presents the hybrid information recovery and extraction
pipeline built to support the models. Several LLMs (including GPT-4.1, Claude 4
Sonnet and Bielik-11B-v2.6) were tested in closed-book and various
Retrieval-Augmented Generation settings. The results show that although the
models achieved satisfactory scores in the knowledge test, none met the passing
threshold in the practical written part, and the evaluations of the
'LLM-as-a-judge' often diverged from the judgments of the official examining
committee. The authors highlight key limitations: susceptibility to
hallucinations, incorrect citation of legal provisions, weaknesses in logical
argumentation, and the need for close collaboration between legal experts and
technical teams. The findings indicate that, despite rapid technological
progress, current LLMs cannot yet replace human judges or independent examiners
in Polish public procurement adjudication.

TL;DR: REMIND是一种新的机器学习遗忘评估方法，通过分析模型在输入微小变化下的损失模式，检测未学习数据在语义相似示例中的残留影响，比现有单点评估方法更敏感和可靠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有遗忘评估方法通常在单个输入层面进行评估，可能忽略语义相似示例中的残留影响，这会危及隐私并导致间接信息泄露。需要更敏感的方法来验证模型是否真正忘记了目标数据。

Method: 提出REMIND方法，通过分析模型在输入微小变化下的损失动态模式来检测未学习数据的残留影响。该方法仅需要基于查询的访问，分析损失曲面的平坦度特征。

Result: 实验表明未学习数据产生更平坦、更不陡峭的损失曲面，而保留或无关数据表现出更尖锐、更易变的模式。REMIND在不同模型、数据集和转述输入下都表现出鲁棒性，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: REMIND为语言模型中的遗忘评估提供了一个更敏感、可解释且可靠的框架，为记忆和遗忘提供了新的视角，适合实际部署。

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove the influence of specific training data
from a model without requiring full retraining. This capability is crucial for
ensuring privacy, safety, and regulatory compliance. Therefore, verifying
whether a model has truly forgotten target data is essential for maintaining
reliability and trustworthiness. However, existing evaluation methods often
assess forgetting at the level of individual inputs. This approach may overlook
residual influence present in semantically similar examples. Such influence can
compromise privacy and lead to indirect information leakage. We propose REMIND
(Residual Memorization In Neighborhood Dynamics), a novel evaluation method
aiming to detect the subtle remaining influence of unlearned data and classify
whether the data has been effectively forgotten. REMIND analyzes the model's
loss over small input variations and reveals patterns unnoticed by single-point
evaluations. We show that unlearned data yield flatter, less steep loss
landscapes, while retained or unrelated data exhibit sharper, more volatile
patterns. REMIND requires only query-based access, outperforms existing methods
under similar constraints, and demonstrates robustness across different models,
datasets, and paraphrased inputs, making it practical for real-world
deployment. By providing a more sensitive and interpretable measure of
unlearning effectiveness, REMIND provides a reliable framework to assess
unlearning in language models. As a result, REMIND offers a novel perspective
on memorization and unlearning.

Motivation: 虽然研究人员致力于改进预训练数据集，但很少有人关注预训练装置从数据中提取知识和思想的效率。本研究旨在量化预训练过程遗漏了多少数据集价值。

Method: 使用检索增强生成和测试时计算来评估预训练后从标准开源数据集中检索信息的效果，并在MMLU、Math-500和SimpleQA等基准上进行验证。

Result: 在MMLU上，检索相当于预训练单独使用的约5倍计算乘数；通过额外测试时计算解析检索上下文，LLaMA 3.1 8B模型在MMLU上实现了10个百分点的改进。

Abstract: Large language models learn from their vast pre-training corpora, gaining the

test-time compute as a way to quantify how much dataset value was left behind
by the process of pre-training, and how this changes across scale. We
demonstrate that pre-training then retrieving from standard and largely
open-sourced datasets results in significant accuracy gains in MMLU, Math-500,
and SimpleQA, which persist through decontamination. For MMLU we observe that
retrieval acts as a ~5x compute multiplier versus pre-training alone. We show
that these results can be further improved by leveraging additional compute at
test time to parse the retrieved context, demonstrating a 10 percentage point
improvement on MMLU for the public LLaMA 3.1 8B model. Overall, our results
suggest that today's pre-training methods do not make full use of the
information in existing pre-training datasets, leaving significant room for
progress.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于图的方法来为主题模型生成有意义的标签，该方法通过丰富主题词并分析它们之间的关系来提升标签质量，在计算效率上与ChatGPT-3.5相当但更高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有主题模型生成的主题词分布缺乏清晰的可解释性，而传统方法计算成本高。本文旨在开发一种计算效率高的方法，为主题词集分配有意义的标签。

Method: 采用基于图的方法，不仅丰富主题词的语义相关术语，还探索它们之间的关系，通过分析图中的连接来推导合适的标签。

Result: 在两个不同数据集上与多个基准方法（包括ChatGPT-3.5）进行比较，该方法在BERTScore和余弦相似度方面持续优于传统基准，结果与ChatGPT-3.5相当但计算效率更高。

Conclusion: 该方法为提升主题标签的可解释性和自动化提供了有效途径，并指出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Extracting topics from text has become an essential task, especially with the
rapid growth of unstructured textual data. Most existing works rely on highly
computational methods to address this challenge. In this paper, we argue that
probabilistic and statistical approaches, such as topic modeling (TM), can
offer effective alternatives that require fewer computational resources. TM is
a statistical method that automatically discovers topics in large collections
of unlabeled text; however, it produces topics as distributions of
representative words, which often lack clear interpretability. Our objective is
to perform topic labeling by assigning meaningful labels to these sets of
words. To achieve this without relying on computationally expensive models, we
propose a graph-based approach that not only enriches topic words with
semantically related terms but also explores the relationships among them. By
analyzing these connections within the graph, we derive suitable labels that
accurately capture each topic's meaning. We present a comparative study between
our proposed method and several benchmarks, including ChatGPT-3.5, across two
different datasets. Our method achieved consistently better results than
traditional benchmarks in terms of BERTScore and cosine similarity and produced
results comparable to ChatGPT-3.5, while remaining computationally efficient.
Finally, we discuss future directions for topic labeling and highlight
potential research avenues for enhancing interpretability and automation.

*Kun Yang,Zikang chen,Yanmeng Wang,Zhigen Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SSPO是一种新的强化学习算法，通过应用句子级别的重要性比率，在GRPO和GSPO之间取得平衡，避免了训练崩溃和高方差问题，同时防止整个响应被裁剪机制丢弃。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR算法如GRPO存在策略更新不稳定问题，GSPO存在采样数据利用率低的问题，需要一种平衡的解决方案。

Method: 提出SSPO算法，应用句子级别的重要性比率，并在PPO-CLIP中应用句子熵来稳定调整裁剪边界。

Result: SSPO在五个数据集上平均得分46.57，超过GRPO(43.01)和GSPO(44.42)，在三个数据集上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: SSPO通过吸收GSPO的优点但拒绝其缺点，在利用生成数据方面表现出色，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: As a significant part of post-training of the Large Language Models (LLMs),
Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Reward (RLVR) has greatly improved LLMs'
reasoning skills. However, some RLVR algorithms, such as GRPO (Group Relative
Policy Optimization) and GSPO (Group Sequence Policy Optimization), are
observed to suffer from unstable policy updates and low usage of sampling data,
respectively. The importance ratio of GRPO is calculated at the token level,
which focuses more on optimizing a single token. This will be easily affected
by outliers, leading to model training collapse. GSPO proposed the calculation
of the response level importance ratio, which solves the problem of high
variance and training noise accumulation in the calculation of the GRPO
importance ratio. However, since all the response tokens share a common
importance ratio, extreme values can easily raise or lower the overall mean,
leading to the entire response being mistakenly discarded, resulting in a
decrease in the utilization of sampled data. This paper introduces SSPO, which
applies sentence-level importance ratio, taking the balance between GRPO and
GSPO. SSPO not only avoids training collapse and high variance, but also
prevents the whole response tokens from being abandoned by the clipping
mechanism. Furthermore, we apply sentence entropy to PPO-CLIP to steadily
adjust the clipping bounds, encouraging high-entropy tokens to explore and
narrow the clipping range of low-entropy tokens. In particular, SSPO achieves
an average score of 46.57 across five datasets, surpassing GRPO (43.01) and
GSPO (44.42), and wins state-of-the-art performance on three datasets. These
results highlight SSPO's effectiveness in leveraging generated data by taking
the essence of GSPO but rejecting its shortcomings.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于可学习性评分的数据选择方法，用于机器翻译系统的微调，通过学习者模型与预训练参考模型的协同作用，显著提升了数据效率和翻译性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据质量及其有效选择是提高机器翻译模型性能的基础，对于构建稳健可靠的翻译系统至关重要。现有方法在数据选择效率和对训练过程的影响方面存在不足。

Method: 提出一种数据选择方法，通过定义可学习性评分来系统评估数据点对训练的效用，并采用考虑数据点间相互依赖关系的批量选择策略，优化训练效率。

Result: 在英语到波斯语等多个语言对上的实验表明，该方法相比iid基线实现了高达5倍的数据效率提升，使用缓存嵌入时计算效率提高24%，且翻译性能优于随机选择方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过智能数据选择显著提升了机器翻译系统的数据效率和计算效率，同时改善了模型的泛化能力和翻译性能。

Abstract: Data quality and its effective selection are fundamental to improving the
performance of machine translation models, serving as cornerstones for
achieving robust and reliable translation systems. This paper presents a data
selection methodology specifically designed for fine-tuning machine translation
systems, which leverages the synergy between a learner model and a pre-trained
reference model to enhance overall training effectiveness. By defining a
learnability score, our approach systematically evaluates the utility of data
points for training, ensuring that only the most relevant and impactful
examples contribute to the fine-tuning process. Furthermore, our method employs
a batch selection strategy which considers interdependencies among data points,
optimizing the efficiency of the training process while maintaining a focus on
data relevance. Experiments on English to Persian and several other language
pairs using an mBART model fine-tuned on the CCMatrix dataset demonstrate that
our method can achieve up to a fivefold improvement in data efficiency compared
to an iid baseline. Experimental results indicate that our approach improves
computational efficiency by 24 when utilizing cached embeddings, as it requires
fewer training data points. Additionally, it enhances generalization, resulting
in superior translation performance compared to random selection method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在时间推理任务上的表现，特别是测试它们能否在特定历史时间背景下回答问题，并比较不同语言提示对结果的影响。

Method: 使用1940年挪威书籍中的琐事问题，让多个LLM模型（DeepSeek-R1、Gemma3、Qwen3、Llama3.1等）以1940年的视角回答问题，分别在英语和挪威语提示下进行测试，采用LLM-as-judge方法进行评分。

Result: 英语提示的结果始终优于挪威语提示，这是一个意外发现。使用更大的LLM模型能改善结果。

Conclusion: LLMs在时间推理任务上表现出一定的能力，但语言选择对结果有显著影响，英语提示比挪威语提示效果更好，模型规模也是影响性能的重要因素。

Abstract: In this study, we experiment with the ability of LLMs to do temporal
reasoning. Using a Norwegian book from 1940 containing trivia questions, we
prompt the LLMs to answer the questions as if it were 1940. We also pose the
questions in both English and Norwegian. Correct answers are often presented as
sentences, and grading is done by means of LLM-as-judge, with sampled checks by
a native speaker. Prompting in English consistently gave better results than in
Norwegian, an unexpected result. In contrast, using larger LLMs improved
results. We tested the DeepSeek-R1, Gemma3, Qwen3, and Llama3.1 model families,
and also the largest available LLM especially crafted for Norwegian.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有抑郁症严重程度预测模型缺乏不确定性估计和时间建模能力，而准确且可解释的预测对临床决策支持至关重要。

Method: 提出PTTSD框架，包含序列到序列和序列到单一两种变体，结合双向LSTM、自注意力机制、残差连接，使用高斯或学生t分布输出头并通过负对数似然训练。

Result: 在E-DAIC和DAIC-WOZ数据集上，PTTSD在纯文本系统中达到最佳性能（E-DAIC上MAE=3.85，DAIC上MAE=3.55），产生良好校准的预测区间。消融实验确认了注意力和概率建模的价值。

Conclusion: 该框架通过三部分校准分析和定性案例研究，展示了不确定性感知预测的可解释性和临床相关性，为抑郁症检测提供了更可靠的工具。

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable predictions of depression severity are essential
for clinical decision support, yet existing models often lack uncertainty
estimates and temporal modeling. We propose PTTSD, a Probabilistic Textual Time
Series Depression Detection framework that predicts PHQ-8 scores from
utterance-level clinical interviews while modeling uncertainty over time. PTTSD
includes sequence-to-sequence and sequence-to-one variants, both combining
bidirectional LSTMs, self-attention, and residual connections with Gaussian or
Student-t output heads trained via negative log-likelihood. Evaluated on E-DAIC
and DAIC-WOZ, PTTSD achieves state-of-the-art performance among text-only
systems (e.g., MAE = 3.85 on E-DAIC, 3.55 on DAIC) and produces well-calibrated
prediction intervals. Ablations confirm the value of attention and
probabilistic modeling, while comparisons with MentalBERT establish generality.
A three-part calibration analysis and qualitative case studies further
highlight the interpretability and clinical relevance of uncertainty-aware
forecasting.

Motivation: 现有基准主要关注高资源语言，泰语在多模态建模中代表性不足，特别是在需要文档结构理解的任务中。

Method: 构建了多样化、人工标注的数据集，在零样本设置下评估了包括专有和开源系统在内的多种最先进视觉语言模型。

Result: 专有模型（如Gemini 2.5 Pro）表现优于开源模型，细粒度文本识别和手写内容提取在开源模型中性能下降最明显。

Conclusion: ThaiOCRBench为低资源、复杂脚本环境下的视觉语言模型评估提供了标准化框架，并为改进泰语文档理解提供了可行见解。

Abstract: We present ThaiOCRBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
vision-language models (VLMs) on Thai text-rich visual understanding tasks.
Despite recent progress in multimodal modeling, existing benchmarks
predominantly focus on high-resource languages, leaving Thai underrepresented,
especially in tasks requiring document structure understanding. ThaiOCRBench
addresses this gap by offering a diverse, human-annotated dataset comprising
2,808 samples across 13 task categories. We evaluate a wide range of
state-of-the-art VLMs in a zero-shot setting, spanning both proprietary and
open-source systems. Results show a significant performance gap, with
proprietary models (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro) outperforming open-source
counterparts. Notably, fine-grained text recognition and handwritten content
extraction exhibit the steepest performance drops among open-source models.
Through detailed error analysis, we identify key challenges such as language
bias, structural mismatch, and hallucinated content. ThaiOCRBench provides a
standardized framework for assessing VLMs in low-resource, script-complex
settings, and provides actionable insights for improving Thai-language document
understanding.

Result: 提交的系统在20个团队中排名第7。后续改进显示，以LLM简化候选作为起点可以进一步提升多轮简化性能。

Conclusion: 多轮简化方法在可读性控制的文本简化中表现良好，特别是将LLM简化结果作为起点可以进一步提升性能，验证了源-目标CEFR级别差距对简化效果的重要性。

Abstract: This paper describes the OUNLP system submitted to the TSAR-2025 Shared Task
(Alva-Manchego et al., 2025), designed for readability-controlled text
simplification using LLM-prompting-based generation. Based on the analysis of
prompt-based text simplification methods, we discovered an interesting finding
that text simplification performance is highly related to the gap between the
source CEFR (Arase et al., 2022) level and the target CEFR level. Inspired by
this finding, we propose two multi-round simplification methods and generate
them via GPT-4o: rule-based simplification (MRS-Rule) and jointly rule-based
LLM simplification (MRS-Joint). Our submitted systems ranked 7 out of 20 teams.
Later improvements with MRS-Joint show that taking the LLM simplified
candidates as the starting point could further boost the multi-round
simplification performance.

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型在人类中心应用中的普及，理解其类似人格的行为对于负责任的发展和部署变得越来越重要。

Method: 应用Big Five Inventory-2 (BFI-2)框架，在不同采样温度下评估六个LLM的人格特质表达。

Result: 在五个人格维度中的四个维度上发现显著差异，神经质和外向性对温度调整敏感；层次聚类揭示了不同的模型聚类，表明架构特征可能导致某些模型具有稳定的人格特征。

Conclusion: 这些结果为LLM中类似人格模式的出现提供了新见解，并为模型调优、选择和AI系统伦理治理提供了新视角。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become integral to human-centered
applications, understanding their personality-like behaviors is increasingly
important for responsible development and deployment. This paper systematically
evaluates six LLMs, applying the Big Five Inventory-2 (BFI-2) framework, to
assess trait expressions under varying sampling temperatures. We find
significant differences across four of the five personality dimensions, with
Neuroticism and Extraversion susceptible to temperature adjustments. Further,
hierarchical clustering reveals distinct model clusters, suggesting that
architectural features may predispose certain models toward stable trait
profiles. Taken together, these results offer new insights into the emergence
of personality-like patterns in LLMs and provide a new perspective on model
tuning, selection, and the ethical governance of AI systems. We share the data

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个两部分的框架来处理放射学报告中的不确定性，包括显性不确定性和隐性不确定性，并发布了Lunguage++基准数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 放射学报告对临床决策至关重要，但包含两种不确定性：显性不确定性（通过模糊表达传达）和隐性不确定性（因省略推理过程而产生），现有基于规则的系统无法有效量化这些不确定性。

Method: 1. 量化显性不确定性：创建专家验证的LLM参考排名，将常见模糊短语映射到概率值；2. 建模隐性不确定性：通过扩展框架系统性地添加从专家定义诊断路径中派生的特征性子发现。

Result: 发布了Lunguage++，这是细粒度结构化放射学报告基准Lunguage的扩展、不确定性感知版本，支持14种常见诊断。

Conclusion: 该框架能够实现不确定性感知的图像分类、忠实诊断推理，并为研究诊断不确定性的临床影响提供了新的研究途径。

Abstract: Radiology reports are invaluable for clinical decision-making and hold great
potential for automated analysis when structured into machine-readable formats.
These reports often contain uncertainty, which we categorize into two distinct
types: (i) Explicit uncertainty reflects doubt about the presence or absence of
findings, conveyed through hedging phrases. These vary in meaning depending on
the context, making rule-based systems insufficient to quantify the level of
uncertainty for specific findings; (ii) Implicit uncertainty arises when
radiologists omit parts of their reasoning, recording only key findings or
diagnoses. Here, it is often unclear whether omitted findings are truly absent
or simply unmentioned for brevity. We address these challenges with a two-part
framework. We quantify explicit uncertainty by creating an expert-validated,
LLM-based reference ranking of common hedging phrases, and mapping each finding
to a probability value based on this reference. In addition, we model implicit
uncertainty through an expansion framework that systematically adds
characteristic sub-findings derived from expert-defined diagnostic pathways for
14 common diagnoses. Using these methods, we release Lunguage++, an expanded,
uncertainty-aware version of the Lunguage benchmark of fine-grained structured
radiology reports. This enriched resource enables uncertainty-aware image
classification, faithful diagnostic reasoning, and new investigations into the
clinical impact of diagnostic uncertainty.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型在生成文本时，单个标记的选择可能导致不同的推理路径，这使得不确定性难以量化。本研究旨在探索语言模型是否在生成过程中表示它们可能采取的替代路径。

Method: 使用隐藏激活来控制和预测语言模型在思维链推理过程中的不确定性，通过激活干预实验来测试模型在不同标记上的不确定性。

Result: 实验发现模型在不同标记上的不确定性与通过控制其激活来引导模型的容易程度存在明显相关性。隐藏激活能够预测模型的未来结果分布。

Conclusion: 激活干预在模型尚未承诺特定最终答案时最为有效，这表明模型隐式地表示可能路径的空间。

Abstract: When a language model generates text, the selection of individual tokens
might lead it down very different reasoning paths, making uncertainty difficult
to quantify. In this work, we consider whether reasoning language models
represent the alternate paths that they could take during generation. To test
this hypothesis, we use hidden activations to control and predict a language
model's uncertainty during chain-of-thought reasoning. In our experiments, we
find a clear correlation between how uncertain a model is at different tokens,
and how easily the model can be steered by controlling its activations. This
suggests that activation interventions are most effective when there are
alternate paths available to the model -- in other words, when it has not yet
committed to a particular final answer. We also find that hidden activations
can predict a model's future outcome distribution, demonstrating that models
implicitly represent the space of possible paths.

graph, where claims are represented as nodes, supporting evidence is attached
as node properties, and edges encode supporting or attacking relations. Unlike

experience: each relation is initially classified and scored by an LLM, then
visualized for enhanced understanding. The system provides justifications for
classifications and produces quantitative measures for essay coherence. It
enables rapid exploration of argumentative quality while retaining human
oversight. In addition, IntelliProof provides a set of tools for a better
understanding of an argumentative essay and its corresponding graph in natural

Abstract: The proliferation of misinformation necessitates robust yet computationally

leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating explanatory rationales,
these methods face significant computational barriers and hallucination risks
in real-world deployments. We present DeReC (Dense Retrieval Classification), a
lightweight framework that demonstrates how general-purpose text embeddings can
effectively replace autoregressive LLM-based approaches in fact verification
tasks. By combining dense retrieval with specialized classification, our system
achieves better accuracy while being significantly more efficient. DeReC
outperforms explanation-generating LLMs in efficiency, reducing runtime by 95%
on RAWFC (23 minutes 36 seconds compared to 454 minutes 12 seconds) and by 92%
on LIAR-RAW (134 minutes 14 seconds compared to 1692 minutes 23 seconds),
showcasing its effectiveness across varying dataset sizes. On the RAWFC
dataset, DeReC achieves an F1 score of 65.58%, surpassing the state-of-the-art
method L-Defense (61.20%). Our results demonstrate that carefully engineered

TL;DR: 本文证明了在标准确定性Karp归约下，对于所有常数ε>0和p>2，SVP_p问题在2^(log^(1-ε)n)因子内近似是NP难的。这是首次证明在有限ℓ_p范数下精确SVP_p是NP难的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 之前对于有限p的SVP_p问题，只有在NP⊈RP的假设下才知道其难度性，且在该假设下仅知道所有常数因子的近似难度。本文旨在提供更强的硬度结果，无需依赖随机化复杂性假设。

Method: 使用与Vandermonde矩阵和Hadamard矩阵相关的简单gadget，从正则化PCP实例直接归约到最短向量问题。证明技术出人意料地基本。

Result: 证明了SVP_p在2^(log^(1-ε)n)因子内近似是NP难的，并且首次证明了在有限ℓ_p范数下精确SVP_p是NP难的。作为推论，在Sliding Scale猜想下，SVP_p在小多项式因子内近似也是NP难的。

Conclusion: 本文提供了比之前结果更强的SVP_p近似硬度结果，无需依赖随机化复杂性假设，且证明技术相对简单基本。

Abstract: We prove that SVP$_p$ is NP-hard to approximate within a factor of
$2^{\log^{1 - \varepsilon} n}$, for all constants $\varepsilon > 0$ and $p >
2$, under standard deterministic Karp reductions. This result is also the first
proof that \emph{exact} SVP$_p$ is NP-hard in a finite $\ell_p$ norm. Hardness
for SVP$_p$ with $p$ finite was previously only known if NP $\not \subseteq$
RP, and under that assumption, hardness of approximation was only known for all
constant factors. As a corollary to our main theorem, we show that under the
Sliding Scale Conjecture, SVP$_p$ is NP-hard to approximate within a small
polynomial factor, for all constants $p > 2$.
  Our proof techniques are surprisingly elementary; we reduce from a
\emph{regularized} PCP instance directly to the shortest vector problem by
using simple gadgets related to Vandermonde matrices and Hadamard matrices.

Motivation: 研究布尔函数单调性测试的查询复杂度下界，填补现有下界与上界之间的差距。

Method: 通过理论分析证明自适应算法在测试布尔函数单调性时的查询复杂度下界。

Abstract: We show that for any constant $c>0$, any (two-sided error) adaptive algorithm

### [91] [What's in Common? Multimodal Models Hallucinate When Reasoning Across Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03768)
*Candace Ross,Florian Bordes,Adina Williams,Polina Kirichenko,Mark Ibrahim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个名为Common-O的新型基准测试，用于评估多模态语言模型在真实场景中的推理能力，发现即使最佳模型在跨场景推理方面表现仍然很差，存在严重的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多模态语言模型在感知基准测试上表现良好，但在真实世界场景推理中仍存在严重的幻觉问题，这表明现有基准测试与真实推理能力之间存在差距。

Method: 构建了包含10,500多个示例的Common-O基准测试，使用未在训练数据中出现的新图像，通过"共同点是什么"的问题来测试跨场景推理能力。

Result: 最佳模型在Common-O上仅达到35%准确率，在更复杂的Common-O Complex上仅达到1%。模型在场景中存在相似物体时更容易产生幻觉，表明模型可能依赖训练中看到的物体共现模式。

Conclusion: 多图像训练可以带来更大改进，表明扩展的多图像训练可能为解决跨场景推理中的幻觉问题提供希望。

Abstract: Multimodal language models possess a remarkable ability to handle an
open-vocabulary's worth of objects. Yet the best models still suffer from
hallucinations when reasoning about scenes in the real world, revealing a gap
between their seemingly strong performance on existing perception benchmarks
that are saturating and their reasoning in the real world. To address this gap,
we build a novel benchmark of in-the-wild scenes that we call Common-O. With
more than 10.5k examples using exclusively new images not found in web training
data to avoid contamination, Common-O goes beyond just perception, inspired by
cognitive tests for humans, to probe reasoning across scenes by asking "what's
in common?". We evaluate leading multimodal language models, including models
specifically trained to perform chain-of-thought reasoning. We find that
perceiving objects in single images is tractable for most models, yet reasoning
across scenes is very challenging even for the best models, including reasoning
models. Despite saturating many leaderboards focusing on perception, the best
performing model only achieves 35% on Common-O -- and on Common-O Complex,
consisting of more complex scenes, the best model achieves only 1%. Curiously,
we find models are more prone to hallucinate when similar objects are present
in the scene, suggesting models may be relying on object co-occurrence seen
during training. Among the models we evaluated, we found scale can provide
modest improvements while models explicitly trained with multi-image inputs
show bigger improvements, suggesting scaled multi-image training may offer
promise. We make our benchmark publicly available to spur research into the
challenge of hallucination when reasoning across scenes.

*Jaden Park,Mu Cai,Feng Yao,Jingbo Shang,Soochahn Lee,Yong Jae Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于多模态语义扰动的新方法来检测视觉语言模型中的测试集泄漏污染问题，解决了现有检测方法失效或不一致的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型使用互联网规模的预训练语料库，存在测试集泄漏导致性能虚高的问题，而现有的检测方法对受污染的VLMs效果不佳。

Method: 通过故意污染开源VLMs，然后提出基于多模态语义扰动的检测方法，利用受污染模型在受控扰动下无法泛化的特性进行检测。

Result: 该方法在多种现实污染策略下都表现出鲁棒性和有效性，能够可靠地检测受污染的视觉语言模型。

Conclusion: 提出的多模态语义扰动检测方法为解决VLMs测试集泄漏问题提供了有效工具，代码和扰动数据集将公开发布。

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved
state-of-the-art performance on numerous benchmark tasks. However, the use of
internet-scale, often proprietary, pretraining corpora raises a critical
concern for both practitioners and users: inflated performance due to test-set
leakage. While prior works have proposed mitigation strategies such as
decontamination of pretraining data and benchmark redesign for LLMs, the
complementary direction of developing detection methods for contaminated VLMs
remains underexplored. To address this gap, we deliberately contaminate
open-source VLMs on popular benchmarks and show that existing detection
approaches either fail outright or exhibit inconsistent behavior. We then
propose a novel simple yet effective detection method based on multi-modal
semantic perturbation, demonstrating that contaminated models fail to
generalize under controlled perturbations. Finally, we validate our approach
across multiple realistic contamination strategies, confirming its robustness
and effectiveness. The code and perturbed dataset will be released publicly.

*Linghui Zeng,Ruixuan Liu,Atiquer Rahman Sarkar,Xiaoqian Jiang,Joyce C. Ho,Li Xiong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FusionDP是一个特征级差分隐私框架，通过利用基础模型对敏感特征进行估算，在保护敏感特征隐私的同时显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗等实际场景中，只有部分特征需要隐私保护，传统DP-SGD对所有特征统一加噪会导致过度噪声注入和性能下降。

Method: 采用两步法：1）利用基础模型根据非敏感特征估算敏感特征作为外部先验；2）改进DP-SGD算法，在原始特征和估算特征上训练模型，同时保护原始敏感特征的隐私。

Result: 在PhysioNet败血症预测和MIMIC-III临床笔记分类任务上，FusionDP相比隐私保护基线显著提升了模型性能。

Conclusion: FusionDP证明了基础模型驱动的估算方法能够有效增强各种模态数据的隐私-效用权衡。

Abstract: Ensuring the privacy of sensitive training data is crucial in
privacy-preserving machine learning. However, in practical scenarios, privacy
protection may be required for only a subset of features. For instance, in ICU
data, demographic attributes like age and gender pose higher privacy risks due
to their re-identification potential, whereas raw lab results are generally
less sensitive. Traditional DP-SGD enforces privacy protection on all features
in one sample, leading to excessive noise injection and significant utility
degradation. We propose FusionDP, a two-step framework that enhances model
utility under feature-level differential privacy. First, FusionDP leverages
large foundation models to impute sensitive features given non-sensitive
features, treating them as external priors that provide high-quality estimates
of sensitive attributes without accessing the true values during model
training. Second, we introduce a modified DP-SGD algorithm that trains models
on both original and imputed features while formally preserving the privacy of
the original sensitive features. We evaluate FusionDP on two modalities: a
sepsis prediction task on tabular data from PhysioNet and a clinical note
classification task from MIMIC-III. By comparing against privacy-preserving
baselines, our results show that FusionDP significantly improves model
performance while maintaining rigorous feature-level privacy, demonstrating the
potential of foundation model-driven imputation to enhance the privacy-utility
trade-off for various modalities.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种学习数据驱动权重的方法来解决过滤近似最近邻搜索问题，相比固定惩罚方法能提高5-10%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于图的方法使用固定、数据无关的惩罚来处理过滤约束，无法在具有不同标签和向量分布的数据集上泛化。

Method: 将问题建模为约束线性优化问题，直接从数据中学习向量距离和过滤匹配之间的最优权衡权重，这些权重指导搜索过程和索引构建。

Result: 实验表明，通过适应数据的距离函数比固定惩罚方法显著提高了5-10%的准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个更灵活和可泛化的过滤近似最近邻搜索框架，能更好地捕捉底层过滤分布和过滤语义。

Abstract: Filtered Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search retrieves the closest
vectors for a query vector from a dataset. It enforces that a specified set of
discrete labels $S$ for the query must be included in the labels of each
retrieved vector. Existing graph-based methods typically incorporate filter
awareness by assigning fixed penalties or prioritizing nodes based on filter
satisfaction. However, since these methods use fixed, data in- dependent
penalties, they often fail to generalize across datasets with diverse label and
vector distributions. In this work, we propose a principled alternative that
learns the optimal trade-off between vector distance and filter match directly
from the data, rather than relying on fixed penalties. We formulate this as a
constrained linear optimization problem, deriving weights that better reflect
the underlying filter distribution and more effectively address the filtered
ANN search problem. These learned weights guide both the search process and
index construction, leading to graph structures that more effectively capture
the underlying filter distribution and filter semantics. Our experiments
demonstrate that adapting the distance function to the data significantly im-
proves accuracy by 5-10% over fixed-penalty methods, providing a more flexible
and generalizable framework for the filtered ANN search problem.

TL;DR: 提出一种路由方法，将问题分配给最可能解决的最小模型，在保持准确性的同时减少计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推理语言模型在复杂任务上表现良好，但由于模型规模和长推理轨迹导致部署成本高昂。

Method: 使用s1.1-32B的中间表示训练轻量级预测器，预测问题难度或模型正确性，以指导在推理模型池中的路由分配。

Result: 在多样化数学基准测试中，路由方法相比随机分配提高了效率，匹配s1.1-32B的性能同时显著减少计算量。

Conclusion: 难度感知路由对于推理模型的成本高效部署是有效的。

Abstract: Reasoning language models perform well on complex tasks but are costly to
deploy due to their size and long reasoning traces. We propose a routing
approach that assigns each problem to the smallest model likely to solve it,
reducing compute without sacrificing accuracy. Using intermediate
representations from s1.1-32B, we train lightweight predictors of problem
difficulty or model correctness to guide routing across a pool of reasoning
models. On diverse math benchmarks, routing improves efficiency over random
assignment and matches s1.1-32B's performance while using significantly less
compute. Our results demonstrate that difficulty-aware routing is effective for
cost-efficient deployment of reasoning models.

TL;DR: SynthKGQA是一个从知识图谱生成高质量合成问答数据集的框架，提供完整的ground-truth事实用于问题推理。该框架应用于Wikidata创建了GTSQA数据集，用于测试KG检索器的零样本泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏具有ground-truth目标的挑战性QA数据集，难以比较不同的图检索方法。需要一种能够生成高质量合成数据集的方法来改进KG检索器的评估和训练。

Method: 提出SynthKGQA框架，可以从任何知识图谱生成高质量的合成知识图谱问答数据集，为每个问题提供完整的ground-truth事实集。

Result: 应用SynthKGQA到Wikidata生成了GTSQA数据集，该数据集专门设计用于测试KG检索器在未见过的图结构和关系类型上的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: SynthKGQA不仅能够实现更信息丰富的KG检索器基准测试，还能训练更好的模型，为KG增强LLMs提供了有效的评估工具。

Abstract: Retrieval of information from graph-structured knowledge bases represents a
promising direction for improving the factuality of LLMs. While various
solutions have been proposed, a comparison of methods is difficult due to the
lack of challenging QA datasets with ground-truth targets for graph retrieval.
We present SynthKGQA, a framework for generating high-quality synthetic
Knowledge Graph Question Answering datasets from any Knowledge Graph, providing
the full set of ground-truth facts in the KG to reason over each question. We
show how, in addition to enabling more informative benchmarking of KG
retrievers, the data produced with SynthKGQA also allows us to train better
models. We apply SynthKGQA to Wikidata to generate GTSQA, a new dataset
designed to test zero-shot generalization abilities of KG retrievers with
respect to unseen graph structures and relation types, and benchmark popular
solutions for KG-augmented LLMs on it.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为StratDiff的创新方法，通过能量引导扩散分层技术解决离线到在线强化学习中的分布偏移问题，显著提升了现有方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线到在线强化学习面临固定行为策略与演化策略之间的分布偏移挑战，现有方法很少明确评估或利用离线数据本身的分布结构，存在适应不同样本类型的学习策略研究空白。

Method: 使用扩散模型从离线数据中学习先验知识，通过基于能量的函数改进策略模仿，在在线微调期间生成离线类动作，基于生成动作与采样动作的KL散度将训练批次分层为离线类和在线类子集，分别采用不同学习策略。

Result: 在D4RL基准测试上的广泛实证评估表明，StratDiff与Cal-QL和IQL集成后显著优于现有方法，实现了增强的适应性和更稳定的性能。

Conclusion: StratDiff方法通过有效利用离线数据的分布结构，成功解决了离线到在线强化学习中的关键挑战，为不同样本类型提供了自适应学习策略。

Abstract: Transitioning from offline to online reinforcement learning (RL) poses
critical challenges due to distributional shifts between the fixed behavior
policy in the offline dataset and the evolving policy during online learning.
Although this issue is widely recognized, few methods attempt to explicitly
assess or utilize the distributional structure of the offline data itself,
leaving a research gap in adapting learning strategies to different types of
samples. To address this challenge, we propose an innovative method,
Energy-Guided Diffusion Stratification (StratDiff), which facilitates smoother
transitions in offline-to-online RL. StratDiff deploys a diffusion model to
learn prior knowledge from the offline dataset. It then refines this knowledge
through energy-based functions to improve policy imitation and generate
offline-like actions during online fine-tuning. The KL divergence between the
generated action and the corresponding sampled action is computed for each
sample and used to stratify the training batch into offline-like and
online-like subsets. Offline-like samples are updated using offline objectives,
while online-like samples follow online learning strategies. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of StratDiff by integrating it with off-the-shelf methods Cal-QL
and IQL. Extensive empirical evaluations on D4RL benchmarks show that StratDiff
significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving enhanced adaptability and
more stable performance across diverse RL settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的许多过程都表现出高阶机制，但在因果发现中对交互作用的显式处理却很少受到关注。本文旨在将因果加性模型扩展到包含高阶交互作用的加性模型。

Method: 引入有向无环超图来表示高阶交互的因果结构，提供理论工具处理这种新结构，开发了贪婪CAM算法的扩展版本来处理更复杂的超DAG搜索空间。

Result: 提供了超DAG的可识别性结果，扩展了典型的马尔可夫等价类。理论分析表明学习更复杂的超图结构可能带来更好的经验结果，特别是在更严格假设下对应更容易学习的超DAG和更好的有限样本复杂性。

Conclusion: 通过合成实验验证了所提方法的实证有效性，表明扩展CAM以处理高阶交互作用是可行且有价值的。

Abstract: Causal structure learning has long been the central task of inferring causal
insights from data. Despite the abundance of real-world processes exhibiting
higher-order mechanisms, however, an explicit treatment of interactions in
causal discovery has received little attention. In this work, we focus on
extending the causal additive model (CAM) to additive models with higher-order
interactions. This second level of modularity we introduce to the structure
learning problem is most easily represented by a directed acyclic hypergraph
which extends the DAG. We introduce the necessary definitions and theoretical
tools to handle the novel structure we introduce and then provide
identifiability results for the hyper DAG, extending the typical Markov
equivalence classes. We next provide insights into why learning the more
complex hypergraph structure may actually lead to better empirical results. In
particular, more restrictive assumptions like CAM correspond to easier-to-learn
hyper DAGs and better finite sample complexity. We finally develop an extension
of the greedy CAM algorithm which can handle the more complex hyper DAG search
space and demonstrate its empirical usefulness in synthetic experiments.

TL;DR: 本文提出SADQ方法，通过显式建模环境动态和集成后继状态分布来解决DQN中目标更新依赖过时策略导致的训练方差大问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DQN的目标更新依赖从回放缓冲区采样的转换，但这些转换中的动作来自过去可能次优的策略，导致状态无法提供有效的学习信号，造成更新过程的高方差。

Method: 提出Successor-state Aggregation Deep Q-Network (SADQ)，使用随机转移模型显式建模环境动态，将后继状态分布集成到Q值估计过程中，并探索基于建模转移结构的更有效动作选择策略。

Result: 理论保证SADQ保持无偏值估计同时减少训练方差。在标准RL基准和现实世界向量控制任务上的实验表明，SADQ在稳定性和学习效率方面一致优于DQN变体。

Conclusion: SADQ通过显式建模环境动态和集成后继状态分布，有效解决了DQN中策略不一致导致的训练不稳定问题，显著提升了强化学习的性能。

Abstract: Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) estimate future returns by learning from transitions
sampled from a replay buffer. However, the target updates in DQN often rely on
next states generated by actions from past, potentially suboptimal, policy. As
a result, these states may not provide informative learning signals, causing
high variance into the update process. This issue is exacerbated when the
sampled transitions are poorly aligned with the agent's current policy. To
address this limitation, we propose the Successor-state Aggregation Deep
Q-Network (SADQ), which explicitly models environment dynamics using a
stochastic transition model. SADQ integrates successor-state distributions into
the Q-value estimation process, enabling more stable and policy-aligned value
updates. Additionally, it explores a more efficient action selection strategy
with the modeled transition structure. We provide theoretical guarantees that
SADQ maintains unbiased value estimates while reducing training variance. Our
extensive empirical results across standard RL benchmarks and real-world
vector-based control tasks demonstrate that SADQ consistently outperforms DQN
variants in both stability and learning efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交协作平台中存在早期互动与后期高影响力结果之间的时间滞后关系，但LLF尚未被时间序列社区视为统一的预测问题，主要由于缺乏标准化数据集。

Method: 构建了两个高容量基准数据集（arXiv：访问量→引用量，涉及230万篇论文；GitHub：推送/星标→分支，涉及300万个仓库），并建立了参数化和非参数化回归基准模型。

Result: 数据集捕获了跨越数年的长期动态，涵盖了完整的结果谱系，避免了生存偏差，并通过统计和分类测试验证了领先-滞后动态的存在。

Conclusion: 本研究确立了LLF作为一种新的预测范式，为在社交和使用数据中系统探索领先-滞后预测奠定了实证基础。

Abstract: Social and collaborative platforms emit multivariate time-series traces in
which early interactions-such as views, likes, or downloads-are followed,
sometimes months or years later, by higher impact like citations, sales, or
reviews. We formalize this setting as Lead-Lag Forecasting (LLF): given an
early usage channel (the lead), predict a correlated but temporally shifted
outcome channel (the lag). Despite the ubiquity of such patterns, LLF has not
been treated as a unified forecasting problem within the time-series community,
largely due to the absence of standardized datasets. To anchor research in LLF,
here we present two high-volume benchmark datasets-arXiv (accesses -> citations
of 2.3M papers) and GitHub (pushes/stars -> forks of 3M repositories)-and
outline additional domains with analogous lead-lag dynamics, including
Wikipedia (page views -> edits), Spotify (streams -> concert attendance),
e-commerce (click-throughs -> purchases), and LinkedIn profile (views ->
messages). Our datasets provide ideal testbeds for lead-lag forecasting, by
capturing long-horizon dynamics across years, spanning the full spectrum of
outcomes, and avoiding survivorship bias in sampling. We documented all
technical details of data curation and cleaning, verified the presence of
lead-lag dynamics through statistical and classification tests, and benchmarked
parametric and non-parametric baselines for regression. Our study establishes
LLF as a novel forecasting paradigm and lays an empirical foundation for its
systematic exploration in social and usage data. Our data portal with downloads
and documentation is available at https://lead-lag-forecasting.github.io/.

### [101] [DecoHD: Decomposed Hyperdimensional Classification under Extreme Memory Budgets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03911)
*Sanggeon Yun,Hyunwoo Oh,Ryozo Masukawa,Mohsen Imani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Decomposition is a proven way to shrink deep networks without changing I/O. We bring this idea to hyperdimensional computing (HDC), where footprint cuts usually shrink the feature axis and erode concentration and robustness. Prior HDC decompositions decode via fixed atomic hypervectors, which are ill-suited for compressing learned class prototypes. We introduce DecoHD, which learns directly in a decomposed HDC parameterization: a small, shared set of per-layer channels with multiplicative binding across layers and bundling at the end, yielding a large representational space from compact factors. DecoHD compresses along the class axis via a lightweight bundling head while preserving native bind-bundle-score; training is end-to-end, and inference remains pure HDC, aligning with in/near-memory accelerators. In evaluation, DecoHD attains extreme memory savings with only minor accuracy degradation under tight deployment budgets. On average it stays within about 0.1-0.15% of a strong non-reduced HDC baseline (worst case 5.7%), is more robust to random bit-flip noise, reaches its accuracy plateau with up to ~97% fewer trainable parameters, and -- in hardware -- delivers roughly 277x/35x energy/speed gains over a CPU (AMD Ryzen 9 9950X), 13.5x/3.7x over a GPU (NVIDIA RTX 4090), and 2.0x/2.4x over a baseline HDC ASIC.

Abstract: Inferring sociodemographic attributes from mobility data could help
transportation planners better leverage passively collected datasets, but this
task remains difficult due to weak and inconsistent relationships between
mobility patterns and sociodemographic traits, as well as limited
generalization across contexts. We address these challenges from three angles.
First, to improve predictive accuracy while retaining interpretability, we
introduce a behaviorally grounded set of higher-order mobility descriptors
based on directed mobility graphs. These features capture structured patterns
in trip sequences, travel modes, and social co-travel, and significantly
improve prediction of age, gender, income, and household structure over
baselines features. Second, we introduce metrics and visual diagnostic tools
that encourage evenness between model confidence and accuracy, enabling
planners to quantify uncertainty. Third, to improve generalization and sample
efficiency, we develop a multitask learning framework that jointly predicts
multiple sociodemographic attributes from a shared representation. This
approach outperforms single-task models, particularly when training data are
limited or when applying models across different time periods (i.e., when the
test set distribution differs from the training set).

### [104] [LogHD: Robust Compression of Hyperdimensional Classifiers via Logarithmic Class-Axis Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03938)
*Sanggeon Yun,Hyunwoo Oh,Ryozo Masukawa,Pietro Mercati,Nathaniel D. Bastian,Mohsen Imani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LogHD是一种超维计算压缩方法，通过类轴对数压缩将内存需求从O(CD)降低到O(Dlog_k C)，同时保持维度D不变，在保持准确性的同时提高鲁棒性和能效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统超维计算中'每类一个原型'的设计需要O(CD)内存，限制了在内存、能耗和可靠性受限系统中的应用。现有压缩方法主要减少特征轴维度D，但会削弱鲁棒性。

Method: 采用对数类轴压缩，用约log_k C个捆绑超向量替代C个每类原型，在n维激活空间解码；使用容量感知码本和基于配置文件的解码，并与特征轴稀疏化结合。

Result: 在多个数据集和注入位翻转条件下，LogHD以更小模型获得竞争性准确性，在相同内存下比特征轴压缩方法能承受2.5-3.0倍的位翻转率；ASIC实现相比AMD Ryzen 9 9950X实现498倍能效和62.6倍加速。

Conclusion: LogHD通过类轴压缩有效解决了超维计算的内存瓶颈问题，在保持准确性的同时显著提高了鲁棒性和能效，特别适合资源受限系统。

Abstract: Hyperdimensional computing (HDC) suits memory, energy, and
reliability-constrained systems, yet the standard "one prototype per class"
design requires $O(CD)$ memory (with $C$ classes and dimensionality $D$). Prior
compaction reduces $D$ (feature axis), improving storage/compute but weakening
robustness. We introduce LogHD, a logarithmic class-axis reduction that
replaces the $C$ per-class prototypes with $n\!\approx\!\lceil\log_k C\rceil$
bundle hypervectors (alphabet size $k$) and decodes in an $n$-dimensional
activation space, cutting memory to $O(D\log_k C)$ while preserving $D$. LogHD
uses a capacity-aware codebook and profile-based decoding, and composes with
feature-axis sparsification. Across datasets and injected bit flips, LogHD
attains competitive accuracy with smaller models and higher resilience at
matched memory. Under equal memory, it sustains target accuracy at roughly
$2.5$-$3.0\times$ higher bit-flip rates than feature-axis compression; an ASIC
instantiation delivers $498\times$ energy efficiency and $62.6\times$ speedup
over an AMD Ryzen 9 9950X and $24.3\times$/$6.58\times$ over an NVIDIA RTX
4090, and is $4.06\times$ more energy-efficient and $2.19\times$ faster than a
feature-axis HDC ASIC baseline.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于条件分数学习的马尔可夫过程快速变化检测方法，避免了显式似然评估，适用于高维数据场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决未知转移核的马尔可夫过程快速变化检测问题，特别是在高维数据场景下，传统方法难以直接评估似然函数。

Method: 通过样本对直接学习条件分数∇_y log p(y|x)，开发基于分数的CUSUM程序，使用条件Hyvarinen分数差异检测核变化，并提出截断统计量确保有界增量。

Result: 证明了均匀遍历马尔可夫过程的指数级误报时间下界和检测延迟的渐近上界，为高维马尔可夫模型中的分数检测提供了理论保证。

Conclusion: 该方法为高维马尔可夫模型中的变化检测提供了理论保证和实际可行性，避免了显式似然评估的困难。

Abstract: We address the problem of quickest change detection in Markov processes with
unknown transition kernels. The key idea is to learn the conditional score
$\nabla_{\mathbf{y}} \log p(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{x})$ directly from sample pairs
$( \mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})$, where both $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ are
high-dimensional data generated by the same transition kernel. In this way, we
avoid explicit likelihood evaluation and provide a practical way to learn the
transition dynamics. Based on this estimation, we develop a score-based CUSUM
procedure that uses conditional Hyvarinen score differences to detect changes
in the kernel. To ensure bounded increments, we propose a truncated version of
the statistic. With Hoeffding's inequality for uniformly ergodic Markov
processes, we prove exponential lower bounds on the mean time to false alarm.
We also prove asymptotic upper bounds on detection delay. These results give
both theoretical guarantees and practical feasibility for score-based detection
in high-dimensional Markov models.

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个针对认知诊断模型的数据遗忘算法HIF，通过分层重要性引导机制解决用户数据删除需求，平衡遗忘完整性、模型效用和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户对"被遗忘权"的需求日益增长，但现有认知诊断模型缺乏隐私考虑和有效的数据遗忘机制，通用遗忘算法难以处理CD模型的异构结构问题。

Method: 提出分层重要性引导遗忘算法(HIF)，利用CD模型中参数重要性呈现分层特性的关键洞察，通过结合个体和层级重要性的创新平滑机制，精确识别与待遗忘数据相关的参数。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上的实验表明，HIF在关键指标上显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: HIF为认知诊断模型响应用户数据删除请求提供了首个有效解决方案，支持部署高性能、隐私保护的AI系统。

Abstract: The need to remove specific student data from cognitive diagnosis (CD) models
has become a pressing requirement, driven by users' growing assertion of their
"right to be forgotten". However, existing CD models are largely designed
without privacy considerations and lack effective data unlearning mechanisms.
Directly applying general purpose unlearning algorithms is suboptimal, as they
struggle to balance unlearning completeness, model utility, and efficiency when
confronted with the unique heterogeneous structure of CD models. To address
this, our paper presents the first systematic study of the data unlearning
problem for CD models, proposing a novel and efficient algorithm: hierarchical
importanceguided forgetting (HIF). Our key insight is that parameter importance
in CD models exhibits distinct layer wise characteristics. HIF leverages this
via an innovative smoothing mechanism that combines individual and layer, level
importance, enabling a more precise distinction of parameters associated with
the data to be unlearned. Experiments on three real world datasets show that
HIF significantly outperforms baselines on key metrics, offering the first
effective solution for CD models to respond to user data removal requests and
for deploying high-performance, privacy preserving AI systems

*Xu Zou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PETRA是一种基于进化轨迹而非原始RNA序列的预训练变换器方法，通过系统发育树构建进化轨迹，有效减轻测序噪声并捕捉病毒进化的层次结构。该方法在预测SARS-CoV-2未来突变方面表现优异，显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SARS-CoV-2的快速进化轨迹给公共卫生和疫苗开发带来持续挑战，而现有的大规模生成预训练变换器直接应用于嘈杂的病毒基因组序列存在局限性。

Method: 提出PETRA方法，基于系统发育树构建进化轨迹而非原始RNA序列，采用加权训练框架解决全球序列数据的地理和时间不平衡问题。

Result: PETRA在预测SARS-CoV-2突变方面表现优异，核苷酸突变的加权召回率@1达到9.45%，刺突蛋白氨基酸突变为17.10%，显著优于基线方法的0.49%和6.64%。

Conclusion: PETRA能够有效预测SARS-CoV-2的未来突变，并展示了在实时预测主要进化支突变方面的能力，为病毒进化建模提供了新思路。

Abstract: Since its emergence, SARS-CoV-2 has demonstrated a rapid and unpredictable
evolutionary trajectory, characterized by the continual emergence of
immune-evasive variants. This poses persistent challenges to public health and
vaccine development.
  While large-scale generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs) have
revolutionized the modeling of sequential data, their direct applications to
noisy viral genomic sequences are limited. In this paper, we introduce
PETRA(Pretrained Evolutionary TRAnsformer), a novel transformer approach based
on evolutionary trajectories derived from phylogenetic trees rather than raw
RNA sequences. This method effectively mitigates sequencing noise and captures
the hierarchical structure of viral evolution.
  With a weighted training framework to address substantial geographical and
temporal imbalances in global sequence data, PETRA excels in predicting future
SARS-CoV-2 mutations, achieving a weighted recall@1 of 9.45% for nucleotide
mutations and 17.10\% for spike amino-acid mutations, compared to 0.49% and
6.64% respectively for the best baseline. PETRA also demonstrates its ability
to aid in the real-time mutation prediction of major clades like 24F(XEC) and
25A(LP.8.1). The code is open sourced on https://github.com/xz-keg/PETra

Abstract: This paper proposes a composable fine-tuning method that integrates graph
structural priors with modular adapters to address the high computational cost
and structural instability faced by large-scale pre-trained models in
multi-task adaptation. The method introduces a relation matrix to model
dependencies among tasks, explicitly encoding correlations between nodes and
paths into graph structural priors, which provide unified structural
constraints for adapter weight allocation and path selection. Modular adapters
are embedded into different layers through low-rank mapping and a pluggable
mechanism, enabling efficient cross-task composition and reuse under prior
guidance. This mechanism not only improves parameter efficiency and training
stability but also alleviates path conflicts and redundant computation in
multi-task scenarios. Furthermore, experiments on hyperparameter sensitivity,
environmental sensitivity, and data sensitivity are conducted to systematically
analyze key factors such as routing temperature, gating thresholds, and
relation matrix regularization strength, verifying the consistency and superior
performance of the method under structural constraints. The results demonstrate
that the proposed framework significantly enhances task prediction accuracy,
adapter weight allocation precision, and overall computational efficiency while
maintaining model lightweight design, highlighting the synergistic advantages
of graph priors and modular mechanisms in composable fine-tuning.

Abstract: The classification of diabetes and prediabetes by static glucose thresholds
obscures the pathophysiological dysglycemia heterogeneity, primarily driven by
insulin resistance (IR), beta-cell dysfunction, and incretin deficiency. This
review demonstrates that continuous glucose monitoring and wearable
technologies enable a paradigm shift towards non-invasive, dynamic metabolic
phenotyping. We show evidence that machine learning models can leverage
high-resolution glucose data from at-home, CGM-enabled oral glucose tolerance
tests to accurately predict gold-standard measures of muscle IR and beta-cell
function. This personalized characterization extends to real-world nutrition,
where an individual's unique postprandial glycemic response (PPGR) to
standardized meals, such as the relative glucose spike to potatoes versus
grapes, could serve as a biomarker for their metabolic subtype. Moreover,
integrating wearable data reveals that habitual diet, sleep, and physical
activity patterns, particularly their timing, are uniquely associated with
specific metabolic dysfunctions, informing precision lifestyle interventions.
The efficacy of dietary mitigators in attenuating PPGR is also shown to be
phenotype-dependent. Collectively, this evidence demonstrates that CGM can
deconstruct the complexity of early dysglycemia into distinct, actionable
subphenotypes. This approach moves beyond simple glycemic control, paving the
way for targeted nutritional, behavioral, and pharmacological strategies
tailored to an individual's core metabolic defects, thereby paving the way for
a new era of precision diabetes prevention.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在资源受限的物联网设备上部署的挑战，特别是自回归推理的迭代token生成过程和扩展的KV缓存需求。

Method: 开发了三点关键技术：1) 单点分割压缩(OPSC)混合精度量化方案；2) 两阶段中间压缩管道(TS+TAB-Q)；3) 联合优化框架选择最优分割点、量化设置和序列长度。

Conclusion: 该框架为资源受限设备上的LLM部署提供了有效的解决方案，平衡了性能、精度和资源约束。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved near-human performance across
diverse reasoning tasks, yet their deployment on resource-constrained
Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices remains impractical due to massive parameter
footprints and memory-intensive autoregressive decoding. While split computing
offers a promising solution by partitioning model execution between edge
devices and cloud servers, existing approaches fail to address the unique
challenges of autoregressive inference, particularly the iterative token
generation process and expanding key-value (KV) cache requirements. This work
introduces the first autoregressive-aware split computing framework designed
explicitly for LLM deployment on edge devices. Our approach makes three key
contributions. First, we develop one-point split compression (OPSC), a
mixed-precision quantization scheme that prevents out-of-memory failures by
strategically partitioning models into front-end and back-end segments with
different precision levels. Second, we propose a two-stage intermediate
compression pipeline that combines threshold splitting (TS) and token-wise
adaptive bit quantization (TAB-Q) to preserve accuracy-critical activations
while dramatically reducing communication overhead. Third, we formulate a
unified optimization framework that jointly selects optimal split points,
quantization settings, and sequence lengths to satisfy strict memory and
latency constraints. Extensive evaluations across diverse LLMs and hardware
platforms demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art
quantization methods, including SmoothQuant, OmniQuant, and Atom. The framework
achieves a 1.49 inference speedup and significant communication overhead
reduction while maintaining or improving model accuracy.

Conclusion: DartQuant在各种模型量化实验中表现出优越性能，使大语言模型量化在资源受限环境中变得可行。

Abstract: Quantization plays a crucial role in accelerating the inference of
large-scale models, and rotational matrices have been shown to effectively
improve quantization performance by smoothing outliers. However, end-to-end
fine-tuning of rotational optimization algorithms incurs high computational
costs and is prone to overfitting. To address this challenge, we propose an
efficient distribution-aware rotational calibration method, DartQuant, which
reduces the complexity of rotational optimization by constraining the
distribution of the activations after rotation. This approach also effectively
reduces reliance on task-specific losses, thereby mitigating the risk of
overfitting. Additionally, we introduce the QR-Orth optimization scheme, which
replaces expensive alternating optimization with a more efficient solution. In
a variety of model quantization experiments, DartQuant demonstrates superior
performance. Compared to existing methods, it achieves 47$\times$ acceleration
and 10$\times$ memory savings for rotational optimization on a 70B model.
Furthermore, it is the first to successfully complete rotational calibration
for a 70B model on a single 3090 GPU, making quantization of large language
models feasible in resource-constrained environments. Code is available at

Abstract: Pediatric appendicitis remains one of the most common causes of acute
abdominal pain in children, and its diagnosis continues to challenge clinicians
due to overlapping symptoms and variable imaging quality. This study aims to
develop and evaluate a deep learning model based on a pretrained ResNet
architecture for automated detection of appendicitis from ultrasound images. We
used the Regensburg Pediatric Appendicitis Dataset, which includes ultrasound
scans, laboratory data, and clinical scores from pediatric patients admitted
with abdominal pain to Children Hospital. Hedwig in Regensburg, Germany. Each
subject had 1 to 15 ultrasound views covering the right lower quadrant,
appendix, lymph nodes, and related structures. For the image based
classification task, ResNet was fine tuned to distinguish appendicitis from
non-appendicitis cases. Images were preprocessed by normalization, resizing,
and augmentation to enhance generalization. The proposed ResNet model achieved
an overall accuracy of 93.44, precision of 91.53, and recall of 89.8,
demonstrating strong performance in identifying appendicitis across
heterogeneous ultrasound views. The model effectively learned discriminative
spatial features, overcoming challenges posed by low contrast, speckle noise,

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究构建了韩国避税面板数据集(KoTaP)，包含2011-2024年韩国非金融上市公司的长期面板数据，用于研究企业避税行为与多个领域的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为韩国企业避税研究提供标准化的长期面板数据集，连接避税行为与盈余管理、盈利能力、稳定性、增长性和公司治理等多个领域，同时保持国际可比性和韩国制度特征的独特性。

Method: 从KOSPI和KOSDAQ上市公司中筛选非金融公司，排除非12月财年结束、资本减损和税前利润为负的公司，最终获得12,653个公司年度观测值。使用现金有效税率(CETR)、GAAP有效税率(GETR)和账面税收差异指标(TSTA、TSDA)衡量避税行为。

Result: 构建了包含1,754家公司的平衡面板数据集，标准化了各类变量，与国际文献在核心指标分布和相关性上保持一致，同时反映了韩国企业所有权集中、外资持股高、流动性比率高等独特制度特征。

Conclusion: KoTaP数据集为会计、金融和跨学科研究提供了重要开放资源，支持计量经济学和深度学习模型基准测试、外部有效性检验、可解释AI分析、政策评估、审计规划和投资分析等应用。

Abstract: This study introduces the Korean Tax Avoidance Panel (KoTaP), a long-term
panel dataset of non-financial firms listed on KOSPI and KOSDAQ between 2011
and 2024. After excluding financial firms, firms with non-December fiscal year
ends, capital impairment, and negative pre-tax income, the final dataset
consists of 12,653 firm-year observations from 1,754 firms. KoTaP is designed
to treat corporate tax avoidance as a predictor variable and link it to
multiple domains, including earnings management (accrual- and activity-based),
profitability (ROA, ROE, CFO, LOSS), stability (LEV, CUR, SIZE, PPE, AGE,
INVREC), growth (GRW, MB, TQ), and governance (BIG4, FORN, OWN). Tax avoidance
itself is measured using complementary indicators cash effective tax rate
(CETR), GAAP effective tax rate (GETR), and book-tax difference measures (TSTA,
TSDA) with adjustments to ensure interpretability. A key strength of KoTaP is
its balanced panel structure with standardized variables and its consistency
with international literature on the distribution and correlation of core
indicators. At the same time, it reflects distinctive institutional features of
Korean firms, such as concentrated ownership, high foreign shareholding, and
elevated liquidity ratios, providing both international comparability and
contextual uniqueness. KoTaP enables applications in benchmarking econometric
and deep learning models, external validity checks, and explainable AI
analyses. It further supports policy evaluation, audit planning, and investment
analysis, making it a critical open resource for accounting, finance, and
interdisciplinary research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统符号回归方法过于关注最小化预测误差，往往产生过于复杂或不准确的表达式，缺乏对控制方程的真实识别。

Method: 使用多集Transformer生成单变量符号骨架，通过遗传算法评估和选择高质量候选，然后通过遗传编程级联程序合并骨架并保持原始结构，最后通过遗传算法优化系数。

Conclusion: 该方法能够生成可解释的多元表达式，在保持数学结构准确性的同时实现良好的预测性能。

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) models complex systems by discovering mathematical
expressions that capture underlying relationships in observed data. However,
most SR methods prioritize minimizing prediction error over identifying the
governing equations, often producing overly complex or inaccurate expressions.
To address this, we present a decomposable SR method that generates
interpretable multivariate expressions leveraging transformer models, genetic
algorithms (GAs), and genetic programming (GP). In particular, our explainable
SR method distills a trained ``opaque'' regression model into mathematical
expressions that serve as explanations of its computed function. Our method
employs a Multi-Set Transformer to generate multiple univariate symbolic
skeletons that characterize how each variable influences the opaque model's
response. We then evaluate the generated skeletons' performance using a
GA-based approach to select a subset of high-quality candidates before
incrementally merging them via a GP-based cascade procedure that preserves
their original skeleton structure. The final multivariate skeletons undergo
coefficient optimization via a GA. We evaluated our method on problems with
controlled and varying degrees of noise, demonstrating lower or comparable
interpolation and extrapolation errors compared to two GP-based methods, three
neural SR methods, and a hybrid approach. Unlike them, our approach
consistently learned expressions that matched the original mathematical
structure.

*Hongbin Zhang,Shihao Gao,Yang Liu,Mingjie Xing,Yanjun Wu,Chen Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文探讨了将大型语言模型（LLM）作为端到端编译器（LaaC）的可行性，通过构建CompilerEval数据集评估LLM在源代码理解和汇编代码生成方面的能力，发现LLM具备基本编译能力但成功率较低，通过优化提示、扩大模型规模和引入推理方法可显著提升汇编代码质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着端到端LLM技术在各领域展现出显著优势，本文旨在探索LLM作为编译器的潜力。编译器作为关键系统软件，其开发维护已开始利用LLM，但LLM作为端到端编译器的可能性尚未充分研究。

Method: 设计了专门的CompilerEval数据集和评估框架，评估主流LLM在源代码理解和汇编代码生成方面的能力。通过分析各种错误、探索多种改进方法，并评估跨平台编译能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，LLM展现出作为编译器的基本能力，但目前编译成功率较低。通过优化提示、扩大模型规模、引入推理方法，可以显著提升LLM生成的汇编代码质量。

Conclusion: 对LaaC持乐观态度，提出了实用的架构设计和未来研究方向。通过针对性训练、知识丰富的提示和专门的基础设施，LaaC有潜力生成高质量汇编代码，并推动编译领域的范式转变。

Abstract: In recent years, end-to-end Large Language Model (LLM) technology has shown
substantial advantages across various domains. As critical system software and
infrastructure, compilers are responsible for transforming source code into
target code. While LLMs have been leveraged to assist in compiler development
and maintenance, their potential as an end-to-end compiler remains largely
unexplored. This paper explores the feasibility of LLM as a Compiler (LaaC) and
its future directions. We designed the CompilerEval dataset and framework
specifically to evaluate the capabilities of mainstream LLMs in source code
comprehension and assembly code generation. In the evaluation, we analyzed
various errors, explored multiple methods to improve LLM-generated code, and
evaluated cross-platform compilation capabilities. Experimental results
demonstrate that LLMs exhibit basic capabilities as compilers but currently
achieve low compilation success rates. By optimizing prompts, scaling up the
model, and incorporating reasoning methods, the quality of assembly code
generated by LLMs can be significantly enhanced. Based on these findings, we
maintain an optimistic outlook for LaaC and propose practical architectural
designs and future research directions. We believe that with targeted training,
knowledge-rich prompts, and specialized infrastructure, LaaC has the potential
to generate high-quality assembly code and drive a paradigm shift in the field
of compilation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了交换策略优化(EPO)框架，用于解决具有无限约束的半无限安全强化学习问题，通过迭代求解带有限约束集的安全RL子问题，并自适应调整活动约束集来确保安全性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实际应用中安全强化学习常涉及无限约束条件（半无限安全RL），如需要在连续参数空间（如每个空间位置）强制执行安全条件，现有方法难以有效处理此类问题。

Method: EPO通过迭代求解有限约束集的安全RL子问题，采用约束扩展和删除机制自适应调整活动集：违反预定义容忍度的约束被添加，拉格朗日乘子为零的约束在策略更新后被移除。

Result: 理论分析表明，在温和假设下，通过EPO训练的策略实现了与最优解相当的性能，同时全局约束违反严格保持在预定界限内。

Conclusion: EPO框架有效解决了半无限安全RL问题，通过交换规则防止工作集无控制增长，支持有效的策略训练，确保确定性有界安全性。

Abstract: Safe reinforcement learning (safe RL) aims to respect safety requirements
while optimizing long-term performance. In many practical applications,
however, the problem involves an infinite number of constraints, known as
semi-infinite safe RL (SI-safe RL). Such constraints typically appear when
safety conditions must be enforced across an entire continuous parameter space,
such as ensuring adequate resource distribution at every spatial location. In
this paper, we propose exchange policy optimization (EPO), an algorithmic
framework that achieves optimal policy performance and deterministic bounded
safety. EPO works by iteratively solving safe RL subproblems with finite
constraint sets and adaptively adjusting the active set through constraint
expansion and deletion. At each iteration, constraints with violations
exceeding the predefined tolerance are added to refine the policy, while those
with zero Lagrange multipliers are removed after the policy update. This
exchange rule prevents uncontrolled growth of the working set and supports
effective policy training. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that, under
mild assumptions, strategies trained via EPO achieve performance comparable to
optimal solutions with global constraint violations strictly remaining within a
prescribed bound.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了如何通过迁移学习将数据丰富机场训练的生成模型高效适配到数据稀缺机场，使用扩散模型和流匹配方法在苏黎世和都柏林机场轨迹数据上进行验证，结果显示仅需5-20%的目标数据即可达到良好性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决二级和区域机场轨迹数据稀缺问题，这些数据对于开发验证空中交通管理解决方案至关重要，但数据不足限制了机器学习方法的应用和大规模仿真分析。

Method: 采用最先进的扩散模型和流匹配架构，在苏黎世机场预训练模型，然后在都柏林机场使用不同比例本地数据（0%-100%）进行微调，评估模型的可迁移性。

Result: 扩散模型仅需5%都柏林数据即可达到竞争性性能，约20%数据达到基准水平性能，始终优于从头训练的模型；流匹配模型泛化能力较弱。

Conclusion: 迁移学习可显著降低空中交通管理中轨迹生成的数据需求，即使在历史记录有限的环境中也能实现逼真的合成数据生成。

Abstract: Access to trajectory data is a key requirement for developing and validating
Air Traffic Management (ATM) solutions, yet many secondary and regional
airports face severe data scarcity. This limits the applicability of machine
learning methods and the ability to perform large-scale simulations or
"what-if" analyses. In this paper, we investigate whether generative models
trained on data-rich airports can be efficiently adapted to data-scarce
airports using transfer learning. We adapt state-of-the-art diffusion- and
flow-matching-based architectures to the aviation domain and evaluate their
transferability between Zurich (source) and Dublin (target) landing trajectory
datasets. Models are pretrained on Zurich and fine-tuned on Dublin with varying
amounts of local data, ranging from 0% to 100%. Results show that
diffusion-based models achieve competitive performance with as little as 5% of
the Dublin data and reach baseline-level performance around 20%, consistently
outperforming models trained from scratch across metrics and visual
inspections. Latent flow matching and latent diffusion models also benefit from
pretraining, though with more variable gains, while flow matching models show
weaker generalization. Despite challenges in capturing rare trajectory
patterns, these findings demonstrate the potential of transfer learning to
substantially reduce data requirements for trajectory generation in ATM,
enabling realistic synthetic data generation even in environments with limited
historical records.

Motivation: 解决异构电子健康记录数据在临床风险分类中的挑战，包括不规则时间模式、大模态差异和复杂语义结构。

Method: 采用特征嵌入层统一表示结构化和非结构化数据，引入可学习时间编码机制捕捉不均匀采样间隔下的动态演化，使用多头自注意力结构进行纵向序列全局依赖建模，设计语义加权池化模块自适应分配关键医疗事件重要性。

Result: 实验结果显示该模型在准确率、召回率、精确率和F1分数上优于传统机器学习和时序深度学习模型，在多源异构EHR环境中实现稳定精确的风险识别。

Conclusion: 该方法为临床智能决策提供了高效可靠的框架，能够有效处理多源异构电子健康记录数据，提升临床风险分类性能。

Abstract: This study proposes a Transformer-based longitudinal modeling method to
address challenges in clinical risk classification with heterogeneous
Electronic Health Record (EHR) data, including irregular temporal patterns,
large modality differences, and complex semantic structures. The method takes
multi-source medical features as input and employs a feature embedding layer to
achieve a unified representation of structured and unstructured data. A
learnable temporal encoding mechanism is introduced to capture dynamic
evolution under uneven sampling intervals. The core model adopts a multi-head
self-attention structure to perform global dependency modeling on longitudinal
sequences, enabling the aggregation of long-term trends and short-term
fluctuations across different temporal scales. To enhance semantic
representation, a semantic-weighted pooling module is designed to assign
adaptive importance to key medical events, improving the discriminative ability
of risk-related features. Finally, a linear mapping layer generates
individual-level risk scores. Experimental results show that the proposed model
outperforms traditional machine learning and temporal deep learning models in
accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-Score, achieving stable and precise risk
identification in multi-source heterogeneous EHR environments and providing an
efficient and reliable framework for clinical intelligent decision-making.

Motivation: 深度集成能提升模型性能和不确定性校准，但通常单独调优各模型。证据表明联合调优可能带来更好性能，因此需要系统研究联合调优策略的影响。

Method: 提出部分重叠保留策略，在联合评估和最大化训练数据使用之间取得平衡。研究联合调优权重衰减、温度缩放和早停对深度集成的影响。

Result: 联合调优通常能匹配或改善性能，但在不同任务和指标上效果差异显著。部分重叠保留策略提供了实用的解决方案。

Conclusion: 研究结果为优化深度集成模型提供了有价值的见解和指导，强调了单独优化与联合优化之间的权衡关系。

Abstract: Deep ensembles are a powerful tool in machine learning, improving both model
performance and uncertainty calibration. While ensembles are typically formed
by training and tuning models individually, evidence suggests that jointly
tuning the ensemble can lead to better performance. This paper investigates the
impact of jointly tuning weight decay, temperature scaling, and early stopping
on both predictive performance and uncertainty quantification. Additionally, we
propose a partially overlapping holdout strategy as a practical compromise
between enabling joint evaluation and maximizing the use of data for training.
Our results demonstrate that jointly tuning the ensemble generally matches or
improves performance, with significant variation in effect size across
different tasks and metrics. We highlight the trade-offs between individual and
joint optimization in deep ensemble training, with the overlapping holdout
strategy offering an attractive practical solution. We believe our findings
provide valuable insights and guidance for practitioners looking to optimize
deep ensemble models. Code is available at:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了PTQ方法在MXFP4格式下的表现，发现GPTQ等方法表现良好，但基于旋转的方法与MXFP4存在严重不兼容。通过分析发现根本原因是MXFP4的PoT块缩放与全局旋转的能量重分配不匹配，并提出了有效的块旋转策略来改进旋转方法在MXFP4上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型规模快速增长带来了巨大的内存、计算和能耗成本，后训练量化是高效部署的解决方案。然而，在MXFP4这种新兴FP4格式下实现准确的W4A4量化仍是一个挑战，需要评估现有PTQ方法在新格式下的适用性。

Method: 建立了MXFP4格式下PTQ方法的全面基准测试，系统评估了包括GPTQ和基于旋转的方法在内的多种技术。通过深入分析发现了MXFP4的PoT块缩放与全局旋转方法之间的根本冲突，并提出了简单的块旋转策略来适配旋转方法。

Result: GPTQ等方法在MXFP4格式下表现稳定，但基于旋转的方法（几乎所有最先进方法都使用）与MXFP4严重不兼容。提出的块旋转策略显著提高了旋转方法在MXFP4上的准确性，在多种LLM上都取得了实质性改进。

Conclusion: 研究结果为从业者提供了明确的指导，并为推进新兴低精度格式下的PTQ研究奠定了基础。提出的块旋转策略有效解决了旋转方法与MXFP4格式的兼容性问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success, but their
rapidly growing scale imposes prohibitive costs in memory, computation, and
energy. Post-training quantization (PTQ) is a promising solution for efficient
deployment, yet achieving accurate W4A4 quantization remains an open challenge.
While most existing methods are designed for INT4 formats, the emergence of
MXFP4 -- a new FP4 format with various hardware support (NVIDIA, AMD, Intel)--
raises questions about the applicability of current techniques. In this work,
we establish a comprehensive benchmark of PTQ methods under the MXFP4 format.
Through systematic evaluation, we find that methods like GPTQ consistently
deliver strong performance, whereas rotation-based approaches, which are almost
used by all state-of-the-art approaches, suffer from severe incompatibility
with MXFP4. We further provide the first in-depth analysis of this conflict,
tracing its root to a fundamental mismatch between MXFP4's PoT (power-of-two)
block scaling and the redistribution of outlier energy via global rotation.
Building on this insight, we propose a simple yet effective block rotation
strategy that adapts rotation-based methods to MXFP4, leading to substantial
accuracy improvements across diverse LLMs. Our findings not only offer clear
guidance for practitioners but also set a foundation for advancing PTQ research
under emerging low-precision formats.

Abstract: Recent advances in computational methods for designing biological sequences
have sparked the development of metrics to evaluate these methods performance
in terms of the fidelity of the designed sequences to a target distribution and
their attainment of desired properties. However, a single software library
implementing these metrics was lacking. In this work we introduce seqme, a
modular and highly extendable open-source Python library, containing
model-agnostic metrics for evaluating computational methods for biological
sequence design. seqme considers three groups of metrics: sequence-based,
embedding-based, and property-based, and is applicable to a wide range of
biological sequences: small molecules, DNA, ncRNA, mRNA, peptides and proteins.
The library offers a number of embedding and property models for biological
sequences, as well as diagnostics and visualization functions to inspect the
results. seqme can be used to evaluate both one-shot and iterative
computational design methods.

Motivation: 时间序列分类在安全关键应用中很重要，但现有深度学习方法通常是黑盒的，难以理解其决策依据。

Method: 提出STL启发的核函数，将原始时间序列映射到与预定义STL公式的对齐程度，联合优化准确性和可解释性。

Result: 在多样化真实世界基准测试中，STELLE实现了有竞争力的准确性，同时提供逻辑上可信的解释。

Conclusion: STELLE框架成功地将分类和解释统一起来，为时间序列分类提供了既准确又可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Time series classification is a task of paramount importance, as this kind of
data often arises in safety-critical applications. However, it is typically
tackled with black-box deep learning methods, making it hard for humans to
understand the rationale behind their output. To take on this challenge, we
propose a novel approach, STELLE (Signal Temporal logic Embedding for
Logically-grounded Learning and Explanation), a neuro-symbolic framework that
unifies classification and explanation through direct embedding of trajectories
into a space of temporal logic concepts. By introducing a novel STL-inspired
kernel that maps raw time series to their alignment with predefined STL
formulae, our model jointly optimises accuracy and interpretability, as each
prediction is accompanied by the most relevant logical concepts that
characterise it. This yields (i) local explanations as human-readable STL
conditions justifying individual predictions, and (ii) global explanations as
class-characterising formulae. Experiments demonstrate that STELLE achieves
competitive accuracy while providing logically faithful explanations, validated
on diverse real-world benchmarks.

Motivation: 从人类偏好中学习是使机器学习模型与主观人类判断对齐的关键，但收集偏好数据成本高昂且耗时，需要更高效的学习范式。

Method: 在RLHF流程中集成主动查询模块，结合RLHF的可扩展性和PBO的样本效率优势，实现主动和样本高效的偏好收集。

Conclusion: 提出的混合框架成功地将RLHF的可扩展性与PBO的查询效率相结合，在保持性能的同时显著提高了样本效率。

Abstract: Learning from human preferences is a cornerstone of aligning machine learning
models with subjective human judgments. Yet, collecting such preference data is
often costly and time-consuming, motivating the need for more efficient
learning paradigms. Two established approaches offer complementary advantages:
RLHF scales effectively to high-dimensional tasks such as LLM fine-tuning,
while PBO achieves greater sample efficiency through active querying. We
propose a hybrid framework that unifies RLHF's scalability with PBO's query
efficiency by integrating an acquisition-driven module into the RLHF pipeline,
thereby enabling active and sample-efficient preference gathering. We validate
the proposed approach on two representative domains: (i) high-dimensional
preference optimization and (ii) LLM fine-tuning. Experimental results
demonstrate consistent improvements in both sample efficiency and overall
performance across these tasks.

Conclusion: 提出的差分隐私上下文学习框架通过整合隐私感知的最近邻搜索，在保护隐私的同时显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Differentially private in-context learning (DP-ICL) has recently become an
active research topic due to the inherent privacy risks of in-context learning.
However, existing approaches overlook a critical component of modern large
language model (LLM) pipelines: the similarity search used to retrieve relevant
context data. In this work, we introduce a DP framework for in-context learning
that integrates nearest neighbor search of relevant examples in a privacy-aware
manner. Our method outperforms existing baselines by a substantial margin
across all evaluated benchmarks, achieving more favorable privacy-utility
trade-offs. To achieve this, we employ nearest neighbor retrieval from a
database of context data, combined with a privacy filter that tracks the
cumulative privacy cost of selected samples to ensure adherence to a central
differential privacy budget. Experimental results on text classification and
document question answering show a clear advantage of the proposed method over
existing baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型容易依赖虚假相关性，在分布偏移时表现脆弱，特别是在子群体偏移场景中，模型在代表性不足的群体上表现不佳。现有方法缺乏连接嵌入空间表示与最差群体误差的理论框架。

Method: 提出SCER方法，通过理论分析识别核心特征方向和虚假特征方向，在嵌入层面对模型施加正则化约束，鼓励模型关注核心特征同时减少对虚假模式的敏感性。

Result: 在多个视觉和语言任务上的系统评估表明，SCER在最差群体准确率上优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: SCER通过理论驱动的嵌入正则化有效提升了模型对分布偏移的鲁棒性，特别是在最差群体上的性能表现。

Abstract: Deep learning models achieve strong performance across various domains but
often rely on spurious correlations, making them vulnerable to distribution
shifts. This issue is particularly severe in subpopulation shift scenarios,
where models struggle in underrepresented groups. While existing methods have
made progress in mitigating this issue, their performance gains are still
constrained. They lack a rigorous theoretical framework connecting the
embedding space representations with worst-group error. To address this
limitation, we propose Spurious Correlation-Aware Embedding Regularization for
Worst-Group Robustness (SCER), a novel approach that directly regularizes
feature representations to suppress spurious cues. We show theoretically that
worst-group error is influenced by how strongly the classifier relies on
spurious versus core directions, identified from differences in group-wise mean
embeddings across domains and classes. By imposing theoretical constraints at
the embedding level, SCER encourages models to focus on core features while
reducing sensitivity to spurious patterns. Through systematic evaluation on
multiple vision and language, we show that SCER outperforms prior
state-of-the-art studies in worst-group accuracy. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界语言具有固有的模糊性，但现有不确定性量化方法通常在无模糊性任务上进行基准测试，无法反映真实部署场景中的性能表现。

Method: 引入MAQA*和AmbigQA*模糊问答数据集，使用事实共现估计真实答案分布，评估了三种不确定性估计范式：预测分布本身、模型内部表示和模型集成。

Result: 当前不确定性估计器在无模糊性假设下表现良好，但在模糊数据上性能降至接近随机水平，且这种现象在不同估计范式中一致存在。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前LLM不确定性量化方法的关键缺陷，需要重新思考当前建模范式以适应现实世界的语言模糊性。

Abstract: Accurate uncertainty quantification (UQ) in Large Language Models (LLMs) is
critical for trustworthy deployment. While real-world language is inherently
ambiguous, reflecting aleatoric uncertainty, existing UQ methods are typically
benchmarked against tasks with no ambiguity. In this work, we demonstrate that
while current uncertainty estimators perform well under the restrictive
assumption of no ambiguity, they degrade to close-to-random performance on
ambiguous data. To this end, we introduce MAQA* and AmbigQA*, the first
ambiguous question-answering (QA) datasets equipped with ground-truth answer
distributions estimated from factual co-occurrence. We find this performance
deterioration to be consistent across different estimation paradigms: using the
predictive distribution itself, internal representations throughout the model,
and an ensemble of models. We show that this phenomenon can be theoretically
explained, revealing that predictive-distribution and ensemble-based estimators
are fundamentally limited under ambiguity. Overall, our study reveals a key
shortcoming of current UQ methods for LLMs and motivates a rethinking of
current modeling paradigms.

### [130] [Federated Stochastic Minimax Optimization under Heavy-Tailed Noises](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04456)
*Xinwen Zhang,Hongchang Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了在联邦学习中具有重尾梯度噪声的非凸-PL极小极大优化问题，提出了两种新算法Fed-NSGDA-M和FedMuon-DA，在较温和条件下有效处理重尾噪声，并建立了收敛速率理论保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重尾噪声在非凸随机优化中受到越来越多关注，因为实证研究表明它比标准有界方差假设更符合实际。本文旨在解决联邦学习中重尾梯度噪声下的极小极大优化问题。

Method: 提出了两种新算法：Fed-NSGDA-M（整合归一化梯度）和FedMuon-DA（利用Muon优化器进行局部更新），专门设计用于在联邦极小极大优化中有效处理重尾噪声。

Result: 理论证明两种算法都达到了$O({1}/{(TNp)^{rac{s-1}{2s}}})$的收敛速率，这是首个在重尾噪声下具有严格理论保证的联邦极小极大优化算法。

Conclusion: 所提出的算法在重尾噪声环境下具有理论保证的收敛性能，并通过大量实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Heavy-tailed noise has attracted growing attention in nonconvex stochastic
optimization, as numerous empirical studies suggest it offers a more realistic
assumption than standard bounded variance assumption. In this work, we
investigate nonconvex-PL minimax optimization under heavy-tailed gradient noise
in federated learning. We propose two novel algorithms: Fed-NSGDA-M, which
integrates normalized gradients, and FedMuon-DA, which leverages the Muon
optimizer for local updates. Both algorithms are designed to effectively
address heavy-tailed noise in federated minimax optimization, under a milder
condition. We theoretically establish that both algorithms achieve a
convergence rate of $O({1}/{(TNp)^{\frac{s-1}{2s}}})$. To the best of our
knowledge, these are the first federated minimax optimization algorithms with
rigorous theoretical guarantees under heavy-tailed noise. Extensive experiments
further validate their effectiveness.

*Dennis Thumm,Luis Ontaneda Mijares*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出TNCM-VAE模型，结合变分自编码器和结构因果模型，生成具有因果推理能力的反事实金融时间序列数据


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有市场生成器缺乏因果推理能力，无法进行反事实分析和风险评估

Method: 在解码器架构中通过有向无环图施加因果约束，并使用因果Wasserstein距离进行训练

Result: 在受Ornstein-Uhlenbeck过程启发的自回归模型上验证，反事实概率估计的L1距离低至0.03-0.10

Conclusion: 该模型能够生成尊重基础因果机制的反事实市场轨迹，支持金融压力测试、情景分析和改进的回测

Abstract: Market generators using deep generative models have shown promise for
synthetic financial data generation, but existing approaches lack causal
reasoning capabilities essential for counterfactual analysis and risk
assessment. We propose a Time-series Neural Causal Model VAE (TNCM-VAE) that
combines variational autoencoders with structural causal models to generate
counterfactual financial time series while preserving both temporal
dependencies and causal relationships. Our approach enforces causal constraints
through directed acyclic graphs in the decoder architecture and employs the
causal Wasserstein distance for training. We validate our method on synthetic
autoregressive models inspired by the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, demonstrating
superior performance in counterfactual probability estimation with L1 distances
as low as 0.03-0.10 compared to ground truth. The model enables financial
stress testing, scenario analysis, and enhanced backtesting by generating
plausible counterfactual market trajectories that respect underlying causal
mechanisms.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的群体公平性方法，通过最小化加权错误损失并在假阴性率差异上设置小容忍度，来解决算法公平性在刑事司法中的冲突问题，并提供了实用的部署框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 算法公平性研究快速发展，但关键概念在刑事司法领域仍不明确，特别是群体、个体和过程公平性之间的冲突问题需要解决。

Method: 开发了标准群体公平性的简单修改方法：不追求受保护群体间的完全平等，而是最小化加权错误损失，同时将假阴性率差异控制在较小容忍范围内。

Result: 该方法使解决方案更容易找到，可以提高预测准确性，并凸显错误成本的伦理选择。

Conclusion: 提出了基于三个支柱的实用部署框架：基于需求的决策、透明度和问责制、以及精确定义和解决方案，将技术设计与合法性联系起来，为使用风险评估工具的机构提供可操作指导。

Abstract: Algorithmic fairness has grown rapidly as a research area, yet key concepts
remain unsettled, especially in criminal justice. We review group, individual,
and process fairness and map the conditions under which they conflict. We then
develop a simple modification to standard group fairness. Rather than exact
parity across protected groups, we minimize a weighted error loss while keeping
differences in false negative rates within a small tolerance. This makes
solutions easier to find, can raise predictive accuracy, and surfaces the
ethical choice of error costs. We situate this proposal within three classes of
critique: biased and incomplete data, latent affirmative action, and the
explosion of subgroup constraints. Finally, we offer a practical framework for
deployment in public decision systems built on three pillars: need-based
decisions, Transparency and accountability, and narrowly tailored definitions
and solutions. Together, these elements link technical design to legitimacy and
provide actionable guidance for agencies that use risk assessment and related
tools.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究线性模式连接性(LMC)在数据偏移下的表现，发现通过小学习率和大批量大小可以减轻数据偏移的影响，LMC有助于在训练效率和多样化集成模型之间取得平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LMC现象在数据偏移条件下的表现，探索如何减轻数据偏移对模型训练的影响，理解LMC在深度学习中的多方面作用。

Method: 将数据偏移解释为随机梯度噪声的额外来源，通过调整学习率和批量大小来减少这种噪声，实验研究LMC在不同条件下的收敛行为。

Result: 小学习率和大批量大小可以减少数据偏移的影响，使模型收敛到相同的局部最小值或具有不同平滑度和泛化能力的区域；通过LMC采样的模型倾向于做出更相似的错误预测。

Conclusion: LMC的益处在于平衡训练效率与从更大、更多样化集成模型中获得的收益，为深度学习训练提供了重要的实践指导。

Abstract: The phenomenon of linear mode connectivity (LMC) links several aspects of
deep learning, including training stability under noisy stochastic gradients,
the smoothness and generalization of local minima (basins), the similarity and
functional diversity of sampled models, and architectural effects on data
processing. In this work, we experimentally study LMC under data shifts and
identify conditions that mitigate their impact. We interpret data shifts as an
additional source of stochastic gradient noise, which can be reduced through
small learning rates and large batch sizes. These parameters influence whether
models converge to the same local minimum or to regions of the loss landscape
with varying smoothness and generalization. Although models sampled via LMC
tend to make similar errors more frequently than those converging to different
basins, the benefit of LMC lies in balancing training efficiency against the
gains achieved from larger, more diverse ensembles. Code and supplementary
materials will be made publicly available at https://github.com/DLR-KI/LMC in
due course.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的降阶模型缺乏稳健的不确定性量化方法，且现有方法通常是特定于架构或训练的，限制了灵活性和泛化能力。

Method: 使用保形预测方法，为降阶模型管道的多个组件（潜在动力学、重构和端到端预测）估计统计预测区间。

Result: 在云微物理学的潜在空间动力学模型上验证了该方法，能够准确预测液滴尺寸分布的演化，并在整个降阶模型管道中量化不确定性。

Conclusion: 该方法为降阶模型提供了一种灵活、通用的不确定性量化框架，适用于各种应用场景。

Abstract: Reduced-order models (ROMs) can efficiently simulate high-dimensional
physical systems, but lack robust uncertainty quantification methods. Existing
approaches are frequently architecture- or training-specific, which limits
flexibility and generalization. We introduce a post hoc, model-agnostic
framework for predictive uncertainty quantification in latent space ROMs that
requires no modification to the underlying architecture or training procedure.
Using conformal prediction, our approach estimates statistical prediction
intervals for multiple components of the ROM pipeline: latent dynamics,
reconstruction, and end-to-end predictions. We demonstrate the method on a
latent space dynamical model for cloud microphysics, where it accurately
predicts the evolution of droplet-size distributions and quantifies uncertainty
across the ROM pipeline.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种时序子图采样器和关系图感知器(RGP)架构，用于解决关系数据中时空依赖和多任务预测的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图模型主要关注空间结构，将时间信息仅作为过滤约束而非建模信号，且通常只支持单任务预测。需要在医疗、金融、电商等领域的关系数据中整合长距离时空依赖并支持多任务预测。

Method: 提出时序子图采样器增强全局上下文，通过检索超出直接邻域的节点来捕获时序相关关系；设计关系图感知器(RGP)架构，利用基于交叉注意力的潜在瓶颈高效整合结构和时序上下文信息。

Result: 在RelBench、SALT和CTU数据集上的实验表明，RGP实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: RGP为关系深度学习提供了一个通用且可扩展的解决方案，支持多样化的预测任务。

Abstract: In domains such as healthcare, finance, and e-commerce, the temporal dynamics
of relational data emerge from complex interactions-such as those between
patients and providers, or users and products across diverse categories. To be
broadly useful, models operating on these data must integrate long-range
spatial and temporal dependencies across diverse types of entities, while also
supporting multiple predictive tasks. However, existing graph models for
relational data primarily focus on spatial structure, treating temporal
information merely as a filtering constraint to exclude future events rather
than a modeling signal, and are typically designed for single-task prediction.
To address these gaps, we introduce a temporal subgraph sampler that enhances
global context by retrieving nodes beyond the immediate neighborhood to capture
temporally relevant relationships. In addition, we propose the Relational Graph
Perceiver (RGP), a graph transformer architecture for relational deep learning
that leverages a cross-attention-based latent bottleneck to efficiently
integrate information from both structural and temporal contexts. This latent
bottleneck integrates signals from different node and edge types into a common
latent space, enabling the model to build global context across the entire
relational system. RGP also incorporates a flexible cross-attention decoder
that supports joint learning across tasks with disjoint label spaces within a
single model. Experiments on RelBench, SALT, and CTU show that RGP delivers
state-of-the-art performance, offering a general and scalable solution for
relational deep learning with support for diverse predictive tasks.

TL;DR: ARETE是一个基于大型语言模型的R包，用于自动化从科学文献中提取物种出现数据，显著提高了数据提取效率并扩展了物种分布范围信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 保护生物学面临的关键挑战是缺乏物种出现数据，而现有文献中的数据通常不是机器可读的，需要大量人工工作来提取。

Method: 开发ARETE R包，利用chatGPT API实现物种出现数据的自动化提取和验证，包括光学字符识别、异常值检测和表格输出等完整流程。

Result: 对100种蜘蛛的测试显示，自动提取的数据使已知分布范围平均扩大了三个数量级，揭示了新的历史分布区域。

Conclusion: ARETE能够快速获取尚未利用的出现数据，改变了需要此类数据的项目工作流程，使研究人员能够更好地分配资源。

Abstract: 1. A hard stop for the implementation of rigorous conservation initiatives is
our lack of key species data, especially occurrence data. Furthermore,
researchers have to contend with an accelerated speed at which new information
must be collected and processed due to anthropogenic activity. Publications
ranging from scientific papers to gray literature contain this crucial
information but their data are often not machine-readable, requiring extensive
human work to be retrieved. 2. We present the ARETE R package, an open-source
software aiming to automate data extraction of species occurrences powered by
large language models, namely using the chatGPT Application Programming
Interface. This R package integrates all steps of the data extraction and
validation process, from Optical Character Recognition to detection of outliers
and output in tabular format. Furthermore, we validate ARETE through systematic
comparison between what is modelled and the work of human annotators. 3. We
demonstrate the usefulness of the approach by comparing range maps produced
using GBIF data and with those automatically extracted for 100 species of
spiders. Newly extracted data allowed to expand the known Extent of Occurrence
by a mean three orders of magnitude, revealing new areas where the species were
found in the past, which mayhave important implications for spatial
conservation planning and extinction risk assessments. 4. ARETE allows faster
access to hitherto untapped occurrence data, a potential game changer in
projects requiring such data. Researchers will be able to better prioritize
resources, manually verifying selected species while maintaining automated
extraction for the majority. This workflow also allows predicting available
bibliographic data during project planning.

Motivation: 多智能体系统在群体机器人和交通路由等应用中至关重要，但去中心化多智能体随机最短路径问题的学习问题尚未得到充分研究，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 在线性函数逼近框架下，使用基于对称性的新论证方法识别最优策略结构，并构建难以学习实例来推导后悔下界。

Result: 建立了对任意数量智能体n的后悔下界Ω(√K)，其中K为回合数，揭示了Dec-MASSPs中固有的学习难度。

Conclusion: 这些发现阐明了去中心化控制的学习复杂性，可为多智能体系统中高效学习算法的设计提供指导。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) are central to applications such as swarm robotics
and traffic routing, where agents must coordinate in a decentralized manner to
achieve a common objective. Stochastic Shortest Path (SSP) problems provide a
natural framework for modeling decentralized control in such settings. While
the problem of learning in SSP has been extensively studied in single-agent
settings, the decentralized multi-agent variant remains largely unexplored. In
this work, we take a step towards addressing that gap. We study decentralized
multi-agent SSPs (Dec-MASSPs) under linear function approximation, where the
transition dynamics and costs are represented using linear models. Applying
novel symmetry-based arguments, we identify the structure of optimal policies.
Our main contribution is the first regret lower bound for this setting based on
the construction of hard-to-learn instances for any number of agents, $n$. Our
regret lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{K})$, over $K$ episodes, highlights the
inherent learning difficulty in Dec-MASSPs. These insights clarify the learning
complexity of decentralized control and can further guide the design of
efficient learning algorithms in multi-agent systems.

Method: 将常规强化学习环境转换为目标条件环境，让智能体自主选择目标进行学习，该方法与底层离策略学习算法无关。

Result: 智能体能够在与外部指导强化学习相当的训练时间内学习解决任务，平均目标成功率得到改善和稳定，但单个目标的性能存在不稳定性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够训练智能体在环境中寻求任何观测到的目标，为特定用例之前的通用智能体训练提供了可能。

Abstract: In this paper we study how transforming regular reinforcement learning
environments into goal-conditioned environments can let agents learn to solve
tasks autonomously and reward-free. We show that an agent can learn to solve
tasks by selecting its own goals in an environment-agnostic way, at training
times comparable to externally guided reinforcement learning. Our method is
independent of the underlying off-policy learning algorithm. Since our method
is environment-agnostic, the agent does not value any goals higher than others,
leading to instability in performance for individual goals. However, in our
experiments, we show that the average goal success rate improves and
stabilizes. An agent trained with this method can be instructed to seek any
observations made in the environment, enabling generic training of agents prior
to specific use cases.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了因果干预中的分布偏离问题，提出了改进方法，为开发更可靠的可解释性方法指明了方向。

Abstract: A common approach to mechanistic interpretability is to causally manipulate
model representations via targeted interventions in order to understand what
those representations encode. Here we ask whether such interventions create
out-of-distribution (divergent) representations, and whether this raises
concerns about how faithful their resulting explanations are to the target
model in its natural state. First, we demonstrate empirically that common
causal intervention techniques often do shift internal representations away
from the natural distribution of the target model. Then, we provide a
theoretical analysis of two classes of such divergences: `harmless' divergences
that occur in the null-space of the weights and from covariance within
behavioral decision boundaries, and `pernicious' divergences that activate
hidden network pathways and cause dormant behavioral changes. Finally, in an
effort to mitigate the pernicious cases, we modify the Counterfactual Latent
(CL) loss from Grant (2025) that regularizes interventions to remain closer to
the natural distributions, reducing the likelihood of harmful divergences while
preserving the interpretive power of interventions. Together, these results
highlight a path towards more reliable interpretability methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准自回归大语言模型的推理过程本质上是顺序的，导致推理时间长且成本高。扩散语言模型（如MDM）能够并行采样，但缺乏对其并行采样能力的严格理论理解。

Method: 通过建立与单变量函数逼近理论的优雅联系，精确刻画了真实分布与采样分布之间的期望散度，并针对任何分布和任何解掩码调度方案进行分析。

Result: 获得了关于采样步数的新的上下界，证明了在某些自然设置下可以在O(log n)步内完成采样而不损失性能，其中n是序列总长度。

Conclusion: 虽然理论上可以通过函数逼近获得最优解掩码调度，但在没有强先验知识的情况下难以竞争；然而，基于分布的总相关性和对偶总相关性等信息论性质，可以在某些自然设置下实现高效并行采样。

Abstract: A major bottleneck of standard auto-regressive large language models is that
their inference process is inherently sequential, resulting in very long and
costly inference times. To circumvent this, practitioners proposed a class of
language models called diffusion language models, of which the masked diffusion
model (MDM) is the most successful. The MDM is able to sample tokens
out-of-order and, ostensibly, many tokens at once and in parallel. However,
there is very limited rigorous understanding of how much parallel sampling
these models can perform without noticeable degradation in their sampling
performance. Prior work of Li and Cai obtained some preliminary bounds, but
these are not tight for many natural classes of distributions. In this work, we
give a new, exact characterization of the expected divergence between the true
distribution and the sampled distribution, for any distribution and any
unmasking schedule for the sampler, showing an elegant connection to the theory
of univariate function approximation.
  By leveraging this connection, we then attain a number of novel lower and
upper bounds for this problem. While the connection to function approximation
in principle gives the optimal unmasking schedule for any distribution, we show
that it is in general impossible to compete with it without strong a priori
knowledge of the distribution, even in seemingly benign settings. However, we
also demonstrate new upper bounds and new sampling schedules in terms of
well-studied information-theoretic properties of the base distribution, namely,
its total correlation and dual total correlation, which show that in some
natural settings, one can sample in $O(log n)$ steps without any visible loss
in performance, where $n$ is the total sequence length.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) offers new opportunities in machine learning,
particularly in addressing data privacy concerns. In contrast to conventional
event-based federated learning, time-triggered federated learning (TT-Fed), as
a general form of both asynchronous and synchronous FL, clusters users into
different tiers based on fixed time intervals. However, the FL network consists
of a growing number of user devices with limited wireless bandwidth,
consequently magnifying issues such as stragglers and communication overhead.
In this paper, we introduce adaptive model pruning to wireless TT-Fed systems
and study the problem of jointly optimizing the pruning ratio and bandwidth
allocation to minimize the training loss while ensuring minimal learning
latency. To answer this question, we perform convergence analysis on the
gradient l_2 norm of the TT-Fed model based on model pruning. Based on the
obtained convergence upper bound, a joint optimization problem of pruning ratio
and wireless bandwidth is formulated to minimize the model training loss under
a given delay threshold. Then, we derive closed-form solutions for wireless
bandwidth and pruning ratio using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker(KKT) conditions. The
simulation results show that model pruning could reduce the communication cost
by 40% while maintaining the model performance at the same level.

Conclusion: 通过恢复具有物理一致性的完整3D动力学，为极端降水的熟练和可靠临近预报提供了可扩展且稳健的途径。

Abstract: Extreme precipitation nowcasting demands high spatiotemporal fidelity and
extended lead times, yet existing approaches remain limited. Numerical Weather
Prediction (NWP) and its deep-learning emulations are too slow and coarse for
rapidly evolving convection, while extrapolation and purely data-driven models
suffer from error accumulation and excessive smoothing. Hybrid 2D radar-based
methods discard crucial vertical information, preventing accurate
reconstruction of height-dependent dynamics. We introduce a gray-box, fully
three-dimensional nowcasting framework that directly processes volumetric radar
reflectivity and couples physically constrained neural operators with
datadriven learning. The model learns vertically varying 3D advection fields
under a conservative advection operator, parameterizes spatially varying
diffusion, and introduces a Brownian-motion--inspired stochastic term to
represent unresolved motions. A residual branch captures small-scale convective
initiation and microphysical variability, while a diffusion-based stochastic
module estimates uncertainty. The framework achieves more accurate forecasts up
to three-hour lead time across precipitation regimes and ranked first in 57\%
of cases in a blind evaluation by 160 meteorologists. By restoring full 3D
dynamics with physical consistency, it offers a scalable and robust pathway for
skillful and reliable nowcasting of extreme precipitation.

Method: 提出了一个算法和任务无关的理论，将遗忘定义为学习者对未来经验的预测分布缺乏自一致性，表现为预测信息的损失。该理论自然地产生了一个衡量算法遗忘倾向的通用指标，并设计了跨分类、回归、生成建模和强化学习的综合实验来验证理论。

Result: 通过实证研究表明，遗忘存在于所有学习设置中，并在决定学习效率方面起着重要作用。实验结果验证了所提出的遗忘理论的有效性。

Conclusion: 这些结果为遗忘建立了原则性的理解，并为分析和改进通用学习算法的信息保留能力奠定了基础。

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in developing general learning algorithms is their
tendency to forget past knowledge when adapting to new data. Addressing this
problem requires a principled understanding of forgetting; yet, despite decades
of study, no unified definition has emerged that provides insights into the
underlying dynamics of learning. We propose an algorithm- and task-agnostic
theory that characterises forgetting as a lack of self-consistency in a
learner's predictive distribution over future experiences, manifesting as a
loss of predictive information. Our theory naturally yields a general measure
of an algorithm's propensity to forget. To validate the theory, we design a
comprehensive set of experiments that span classification, regression,
generative modelling, and reinforcement learning. We empirically demonstrate
how forgetting is present across all learning settings and plays a significant
role in determining learning efficiency. Together, these results establish a
principled understanding of forgetting and lay the foundation for analysing and
improving the information retention capabilities of general learning
algorithms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究采用经典测验理论、机器学习和无监督聚类的多方法框架评估了198名学生参加的40项数学分班考试。分析发现55%的项目具有优秀区分度，30%需要替换，第6题是最佳区分项。机器学习算法准确率高达97.5%，聚类分析识别出42.5%的自然能力分界点，与机构55%阈值存在差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过多方法集成评估数学分班考试的有效性，为基于证据的数学分班优化提供实证基础，解决传统单一方法的局限性。

Method: 结合经典测验理论（项目区分度分析）、机器学习（随机森林、梯度提升）和无监督聚类（K-means），对40项数学分班考试数据进行综合分析。

Result: 55%项目区分度优秀，30%需要替换；第6题是最佳区分项；机器学习算法准确率达96-97.5%；聚类识别出42.5%自然能力分界点，与机构55%阈值不符；双聚类方案稳定性高。

Conclusion: 多方法集成提供了强大的实证基础，建议替换低区分度项目、实施两阶段评估、整合随机森林预测与透明度机制，实现基于证据的数学分班优化。

Abstract: This study evaluates a 40-item mathematics placement examination administered
to 198 students using a multi-method framework combining Classical Test Theory,
machine learning, and unsupervised clustering. Classical Test Theory analysis
reveals that 55\% of items achieve excellent discrimination ($D \geq 0.40$)
while 30\% demonstrate poor discrimination ($D < 0.20$) requiring replacement.
Question 6 (Graph Interpretation) emerges as the examination's most powerful
discriminator, achieving perfect discrimination ($D = 1.000$), highest ANOVA
F-statistic ($F = 4609.1$), and maximum Random Forest feature importance
(0.206), accounting for 20.6\% of predictive power. Machine learning algorithms
demonstrate exceptional performance, with Random Forest and Gradient Boosting
achieving 97.5\% and 96.0\% cross-validation accuracy. K-means clustering
identifies a natural binary competency structure with a boundary at 42.5\%,
diverging from the institutional threshold of 55\% and suggesting potential
overclassification into remedial categories. The two-cluster solution exhibits
exceptional stability (bootstrap ARI = 0.855) with perfect lower-cluster
purity. Convergent evidence across methods supports specific refinements:
replace poorly discriminating items, implement a two-stage assessment, and
integrate Random Forest predictions with transparency mechanisms. These
findings demonstrate that multi-method integration provides a robust empirical
foundation for evidence-based mathematics placement optimization.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究评估了自然语言处理分词模型在汇编代码分析中的内在特性，包括词汇量大小、语义覆盖等，并探讨了预处理定制选项和预分词规则对下游任务（如函数签名预测）的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 汇编代码分析中的分词方法研究不足，但其对词汇量大小、语义覆盖和下游任务性能有重要影响，需要系统评估不同分词模型在汇编代码分析中的效果。

Method: 系统研究各种分词模型，分析其在编码汇编指令和捕捉语义细微差别方面的效率。使用最先进的预训练模型（Llama 3.2、BERT、BART）评估分词器在多个性能指标上的有效性。

Result: 初步发现表明分词器选择显著影响下游性能，内在指标只能部分预测外在评估结果。这些结果揭示了内在分词器特性与实际汇编代码任务效用之间的复杂权衡。

Conclusion: 本研究为优化低级代码分析的分词模型提供了宝贵见解，有助于提高基于自然语言模型的二进制分析工作流程的鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Tokenization is fundamental in assembly code analysis, impacting intrinsic
characteristics like vocabulary size, semantic coverage, and extrinsic
performance in downstream tasks. Despite its significance, tokenization in the
context of assembly code remains an underexplored area. This study aims to
address this gap by evaluating the intrinsic properties of Natural Language
Processing (NLP) tokenization models and parameter choices, such as vocabulary
size. We explore preprocessing customization options and pre-tokenization rules
tailored to the unique characteristics of assembly code. Additionally, we
assess their impact on downstream tasks like function signature prediction -- a
critical problem in binary code analysis.
  To this end, we conduct a thorough study on various tokenization models,
systematically analyzing their efficiency in encoding assembly instructions and
capturing semantic nuances. Through intrinsic evaluations, we compare
tokenizers based on tokenization efficiency, vocabulary compression, and
representational fidelity for assembly code. Using state-of-the-art pre-trained
models such as the decoder-only Large Language Model (LLM) Llama 3.2, the
encoder-only transformer BERT, and the encoder-decoder model BART, we evaluate
the effectiveness of these tokenizers across multiple performance metrics.
Preliminary findings indicate that tokenizer choice significantly influences
downstream performance, with intrinsic metrics providing partial but incomplete
predictability of extrinsic evaluation outcomes. These results reveal complex
trade-offs between intrinsic tokenizer properties and their utility in
practical assembly code tasks. Ultimately, this study provides valuable
insights into optimizing tokenization models for low-level code analysis,
contributing to the robustness and scalability of Natural Language Model
(NLM)-based binary analysis workflows.

Motivation: 探索文本或图像表示哪种方式能更有效地最大化多模态大语言模型在用户行为数据推理中的性能

Method: 开发BehaviorLens基准测试框架，在6个MLLMs上评估交易数据的三种表示方式：文本段落、散点图和流程图，使用真实世界购买序列数据集

Result: 当数据表示为图像时，MLLMs的下一购买预测准确率相比等效文本表示提高了87.5%，且无需额外计算成本

Conclusion: 图像表示在多模态大语言模型的用户行为推理中比文本表示更有效，能显著提升预测性能

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are reshaping how modern agentic
systems reason over sequential user-behavior data. However, whether textual or
image representations of user behavior data are more effective for maximizing
MLLM performance remains underexplored. We present \texttt{BehaviorLens}, a
systematic benchmarking framework for assessing modality trade-offs in
user-behavior reasoning across six MLLMs by representing transaction data as
(1) a text paragraph, (2) a scatter plot, and (3) a flowchart. Using a
real-world purchase-sequence dataset, we find that when data is represented as
images, MLLMs next-purchase prediction accuracy is improved by 87.5% compared
with an equivalent textual representation without any additional computational
cost.

*Kevin Hong,Kia Karbasi,Gregory Pottie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文挑战了深度知识追踪(DKT)性能优势源于建模知识组件间双向关系的传统解释，证明DKT的真正优势在于其隐式建模先决条件关系作为因果结构的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算教育研究中长期目标是开发可解释的知识追踪模型。DKT作为传统方法的重大进展，其性能提升原因存在争议，需要澄清DKT真正的工作原理。

Method: 通过将练习关系图修剪为有向无环图(DAG)，在Assistments数据集的因果子集上训练DKT，并使用DKT学习表示提取练习关系DAG的替代方法。

Result: 实验表明DKT的预测能力与这些因果结构高度一致，其学习表示能有效提取因果依赖关系，支持DKT有效性主要源于近似知识组件间因果依赖的结论。

Conclusion: DKT的有效性主要由其近似知识组件间因果依赖关系的能力驱动，而非简单的双向关系映射，这为理解DKT工作机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: A longstanding goal in computational educational research is to develop
explainable knowledge tracing (KT) models. Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT), which
leverages a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict student knowledge and
performance on exercises, has been proposed as a major advancement over
traditional KT methods. Several studies suggest that its performance gains stem
from its ability to model bidirectional relationships between different
knowledge components (KCs) within a course, enabling the inference of a
student's understanding of one KC from their performance on others. In this
paper, we challenge this prevailing explanation and demonstrate that DKT's
strength lies in its implicit ability to model prerequisite relationships as a
causal structure, rather than bidirectional relationships. By pruning exercise
relation graphs into Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and training DKT on causal
subsets of the Assistments dataset, we show that DKT's predictive capabilities
align strongly with these causal structures. Furthermore, we propose an
alternative method for extracting exercise relation DAGs using DKT's learned
representations and provide empirical evidence supporting our claim. Our
findings suggest that DKT's effectiveness is largely driven by its capacity to
approximate causal dependencies between KCs rather than simple relational
mappings.

### [149] [LLMs and Cultural Values: the Impact of Prompt Language and Explicit Cultural Framing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03980)
*Bram Bulté,Ayla Rigouts Terryn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究探讨大型语言模型（LLMs）在文化价值观方面的表现，发现提示语言和文化框架会影响模型输出，但无法克服模型对特定国家（荷兰、德国、美国、日本）价值观的系统性偏好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在全球范围内被广泛使用，需要评估这些模型是否能代表其多样化用户群体的文化多样性，特别是考虑到训练数据和优化目标中存在的不平衡问题。

Method: 使用来自Hofstede价值观调查模块和世界价值观调查的63个项目，翻译成11种语言，以带有和不带有明确文化视角的提示形式测试10个LLMs。

Result: 提示语言和文化视角都会导致LLM输出变化，但模型对所有话题都产生相当中立的回应，仅在如社会容忍度等特定问题上表现出选择性进步立场。明确的文视角比针对性提示语言更能提高与人类受访者文化价值观的一致性。

Conclusion: LLMs处于一个尴尬的中间地带：它们对提示变化足够敏感以产生变化，但又过于固着于特定的文化默认值，无法充分代表文化多样性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly being adopted by users across the
globe, who interact with them in a diverse range of languages. At the same
time, there are well-documented imbalances in the training data and
optimisation objectives of this technology, raising doubts as to whether LLMs
can represent the cultural diversity of their broad user base. In this study,
we look at LLMs and cultural values and examine how prompt language and
cultural framing influence model responses and their alignment with human
values in different countries. We probe 10 LLMs with 63 items from the Hofstede
Values Survey Module and World Values Survey, translated into 11 languages, and
formulated as prompts with and without different explicit cultural
perspectives. Our study confirms that both prompt language and cultural
perspective produce variation in LLM outputs, but with an important caveat:
While targeted prompting can, to a certain extent, steer LLM responses in the
direction of the predominant values of the corresponding countries, it does not
overcome the models' systematic bias toward the values associated with a
restricted set of countries in our dataset: the Netherlands, Germany, the US,
and Japan. All tested models, regardless of their origin, exhibit remarkably
similar patterns: They produce fairly neutral responses on most topics, with
selective progressive stances on issues such as social tolerance. Alignment
with cultural values of human respondents is improved more with an explicit
cultural perspective than with a targeted prompt language. Unexpectedly,
combining both approaches is no more effective than cultural framing with an
English prompt. These findings reveal that LLMs occupy an uncomfortable middle
ground: They are responsive enough to changes in prompts to produce variation,
but too firmly anchored to specific cultural defaults to adequately represent
cultural diversity.

Motivation: 多智能体AI系统基于大语言模型，具有非确定性和易发生静默故障（如漂移、循环、输出细节缺失）的特点，这些故障难以检测。

Method: 提出了一个数据集构建流程，捕捉用户行为、智能体非确定性和LLM变化，并创建了两个基准数据集。使用监督学习(XGBoost)和半监督学习(SVDD)方法进行异常检测。

Result: 监督学习方法准确率达到98%，半监督学习方法准确率达到96%。提供了首个关于多智能体AI系统异常检测的系统性研究。

Conclusion: 这项研究为多智能体AI系统的异常检测提供了数据集、基准测试和见解，指导未来研究。

Abstract: Multi-Agentic AI systems, powered by large language models (LLMs), are
inherently non-deterministic and prone to silent failures such as drift,
cycles, and missing details in outputs, which are difficult to detect. We
introduce the task of anomaly detection in agentic trajectories to identify
these failures and present a dataset curation pipeline that captures user
behavior, agent non-determinism, and LLM variation. Using this pipeline, we
curate and label two benchmark datasets comprising \textbf{4,275 and 894}
trajectories from Multi-Agentic AI systems. Benchmarking anomaly detection
methods on these datasets, we show that supervised (XGBoost) and
semi-supervised (SVDD) approaches perform comparably, achieving accuracies up
to 98% and 96%, respectively. This work provides the first systematic study of
anomaly detection in Multi-Agentic AI systems, offering datasets, benchmarks,
and insights to guide future research.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了大语言模型（LLMs）中数值推理错误的内部表示机制，发现LLMs会编码现实世界的数值相关性但会系统性放大它们，无关上下文会导致数值表示的一致偏移，这些发现揭示了LLM决策中的脆弱性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管行为研究已记录了大语言模型中的数值推理错误，但底层的表示机制仍不清楚。研究者假设数值属性占据共享的潜在子空间，并探究LLMs如何内部整合单个实体的多个数值属性，以及无关数值上下文如何干扰这些表示及其下游输出。

Method: 结合线性探测与偏相关分析，以及在不同规模模型上进行基于提示的脆弱性测试，来研究LLMs内部数值属性的表示机制。

Result: 结果显示LLMs编码了现实世界的数值相关性但倾向于系统性放大它们，无关上下文会导致数值表示的一致偏移，且下游影响因模型规模而异。

Conclusion: 这些发现揭示了LLM决策中的脆弱性，为在多属性纠缠下实现更公平、表示感知的控制奠定了基础。

Abstract: Although behavioral studies have documented numerical reasoning errors in
large language models (LLMs), the underlying representational mechanisms remain
unclear. We hypothesize that numerical attributes occupy shared latent
subspaces and investigate two questions:(1) How do LLMs internally integrate
multiple numerical attributes of a single entity? (2)How does irrelevant
numerical context perturb these representations and their downstream outputs?
To address these questions, we combine linear probing with partial correlation
analysis and prompt-based vulnerability tests across models of varying sizes.
Our results show that LLMs encode real-world numerical correlations but tend to
systematically amplify them. Moreover, irrelevant context induces consistent
shifts in magnitude representations, with downstream effects that vary by model
size. These findings reveal a vulnerability in LLM decision-making and lay the
groundwork for fairer, representation-aware control under multi-attribute
entanglement.

TL;DR: Agentmandering是一个基于LLM智能体的选区重划框架，将重划过程建模为两党智能体的回合制谈判，显著降低党派偏见和方差


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有计算方法主要生成合法选区重划方案，但忽略了选择过程中的战略动态，为党派行为者挑选政治有利的地图创造了机会

Method: 受博弈论启发，采用Choose-and-Freeze协议，让代表对立政治利益的LLM智能体轮流从候选地图中选择和冻结选区，通过约束性选择逐步划分州

Result: 在2020年美国人口普查数据上的评估显示，相比基线方法，Agentmandering显著降低党派偏见和不公平性，方差降低2-3个数量级，在摇摆州场景中表现尤其公平稳定

Conclusion: 该框架通过嵌入战略互动到选区重划过程，实现了公平性和稳定性的双重提升，证明了博弈论方法在政治地图绘制中的有效性

Abstract: Redistricting plays a central role in shaping how votes are translated into
political power. While existing computational methods primarily aim to generate
large ensembles of legally valid districting plans, they often neglect the
strategic dynamics involved in the selection process. This oversight creates
opportunities for partisan actors to cherry-pick maps that, while technically
compliant, are politically advantageous. Simply satisfying formal constraints
does not ensure fairness when the selection process itself can be manipulated.
We propose \textbf{Agentmandering}, a framework that reimagines redistricting
as a turn-based negotiation between two agents representing opposing political
interests. Drawing inspiration from game-theoretic ideas, particularly the
\textit{Choose-and-Freeze} protocol, our method embeds strategic interaction
into the redistricting process via large language model (LLM) agents. Agents
alternate between selecting and freezing districts from a small set of
candidate maps, gradually partitioning the state through constrained and
interpretable choices. Evaluation on post-2020 U.S. Census data across all
states shows that Agentmandering significantly reduces partisan bias and
unfairness, while achieving 2 to 3 orders of magnitude lower variance than
standard baselines. These results demonstrate both fairness and stability,
especially in swing-state scenarios. Our code is available at

Abstract: This paper introduces the Opus Workflow Evaluation Framework, a
probabilistic-normative formulation for quantifying Workflow quality and
efficiency. It integrates notions of correctness, reliability, and cost into a
coherent mathematical model that enables direct comparison, scoring, and
optimization of Workflows. The framework combines the Opus Workflow Reward, a
probabilistic function estimating expected performance through success
likelihood, resource usage, and output gain, with the Opus Workflow Normative
Penalties, a set of measurable functions capturing structural and informational
quality across Cohesion, Coupling, Observability, and Information Hygiene. It
supports automated Workflow assessment, ranking, and optimization within modern
automation systems such as Opus and can be integrated into Reinforcement
Learning loops to guide Workflow discovery and refinement. In this paper, we
introduce the Opus Workflow Reward model that formalizes Workflow success as a
probabilistic expectation over costs and outcomes. We define measurable Opus
Workflow Normative Penalties capturing structural, semantic, and signal-related
properties of Workflows. Finally, we propose a unified optimization formulation
for identifying and ranking optimal Workflows under joint Reward-Penalty
trade-offs.

Motivation: 多智能体系统中部分可观测性和有限带宽导致协调失败，需要开发能够有效共享和重建一致空间记忆的方法。

Method: 基于信息瓶颈目标的多智能体预测编码框架，包括自监督运动预测产生的网格细胞状度量编码、带宽高效通信机制、类似海马体社交位置细胞的神经群体，以及分层强化学习策略。

Result: 在Memory-Maze基准测试中，当带宽从128位/步缩减到4位/步时，成功率从73.5%优雅下降到64.4%，而全广播基线从67.6%崩溃到28.6%。

Conclusion: 该研究为复杂社交表征如何从统一的预测驱动中涌现提供了理论原则和生物学上合理的基础，实现了社交集体智能。

Abstract: Sharing and reconstructing a consistent spatial memory is a critical
challenge in multi-agent systems, where partial observability and limited
bandwidth often lead to catastrophic failures in coordination. We introduce a
multi-agent predictive coding framework that formulate coordination as the
minimization of mutual uncertainty among agents. Instantiated as an information
bottleneck objective, it prompts agents to learn not only who and what to
communicate but also when. At the foundation of this framework lies a
grid-cell-like metric as internal spatial coding for self-localization,
emerging spontaneously from self-supervised motion prediction. Building upon
this internal spatial code, agents gradually develop a bandwidth-efficient
communication mechanism and specialized neural populations that encode
partners' locations: an artificial analogue of hippocampal social place cells
(SPCs). These social representations are further enacted by a hierarchical
reinforcement learning policy that actively explores to reduce joint
uncertainty. On the Memory-Maze benchmark, our approach shows exceptional
resilience to bandwidth constraints: success degrades gracefully from 73.5% to
64.4% as bandwidth shrinks from 128 to 4 bits/step, whereas a full-broadcast
baseline collapses from 67.6% to 28.6%. Our findings establish a theoretically
principled and biologically plausible basis for how complex social
representations emerge from a unified predictive drive, leading to social
collective intelligence.

TL;DR: RLoop是一个自改进框架，通过迭代策略初始化解决RL训练中的过拟合问题，将训练过程转化为探索和利用的良性循环，显著提升泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决强化学习在可验证奖励训练中的过拟合问题，即模型获得训练奖励但失去泛化能力，这由策略过度专业化和训练期间生成多样解决方案的灾难性遗忘驱动。

Method: 引入RLoop框架，基于迭代策略初始化：首先使用RL从给定策略探索解决方案空间，然后过滤成功轨迹创建专家数据集，通过拒绝采样微调(RFT)优化初始策略，为下一次迭代创建更好的起点。

Result: RLoop有效缓解遗忘并显著改善泛化，相比原始RL方法，平均准确率提升9%，pass@32提升超过15%。

Conclusion: RLoop通过将瞬态策略变化转化为稳健性能增益的探索-利用循环，成功解决了RL训练中的过拟合和泛化问题。

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning for Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is powerful for
training large reasoning models, its training dynamics harbor a critical
challenge: RL overfitting, where models gain training rewards but lose
generalization. Our analysis reveals this is driven by policy
over-specialization and catastrophic forgetting of diverse solutions generated
during training. Standard optimization discards this valuable inter-step policy
diversity. To address this, we introduce RLoop, a self-improving framework
built on iterative policy initialization. RLoop transforms the standard
training process into a virtuous cycle: it first uses RL to explore the
solution space from a given policy, then filters the successful trajectories to
create an expert dataset. This dataset is used via Rejection-sampling
Fine-Tuning (RFT) to refine the initial policy, creating a superior starting
point for the next iteration. This loop of exploration and exploitation via
iterative re-initialization effectively converts transient policy variations
into robust performance gains. Our experiments show RLoop mitigates forgetting
and substantially improves generalization, boosting average accuracy by 9% and
pass@32 by over 15% compared to vanilla RL.

TL;DR: 论文指出在可解释AI中，仅凭概念激活向量(CAV)的探针分类准确性无法可靠衡量概念对齐度，因为探针更可能捕捉虚假相关性而非目标概念。作者提出了基于空间线性归因的新概念定位方法，并引入三类定量评估概念对齐的指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前CAV方法仅依赖探针分类准确性来评估概念表示质量，但这种方法不可靠，因为探针可能捕捉虚假相关性而非真正概念。需要更可靠的评估方法来确保CAV确实捕获了目标概念。

Method: 1) 分析标准探针方法的局限性；2) 提出基于空间线性归因的概念定位方法；3) 与现有特征可视化技术进行比较；4) 引入三类概念对齐评估指标：硬准确性、分割分数和增强鲁棒性。

Result: 研究发现：1) 故意构建的错位探针能达到与标准探针相近的准确性；2) 具有平移不变性和空间对齐的探针能持续提高概念对齐度；3) 新提出的评估指标能更可靠地检测概念错位问题。

Conclusion: 需要基于对齐度的评估指标而非探针准确性，并且需要根据模型架构和目标概念特性定制探针设计。概念对齐评估应该考虑空间对齐和鲁棒性等因素。

Abstract: In explainable AI, Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) are typically obtained
by training linear classifier probes to detect human-understandable concepts as
directions in the activation space of deep neural networks. It is widely
assumed that a high probe accuracy indicates a CAV faithfully representing its
target concept. However, we show that the probe's classification accuracy alone
is an unreliable measure of concept alignment, i.e., the degree to which a CAV
captures the intended concept. In fact, we argue that probes are more likely to
capture spurious correlations than they are to represent only the intended
concept. As part of our analysis, we demonstrate that deliberately misaligned
probes constructed to exploit spurious correlations, achieve an accuracy close
to that of standard probes. To address this severe problem, we introduce a
novel concept localization method based on spatial linear attribution, and
provide a comprehensive comparison of it to existing feature visualization
techniques for detecting and mitigating concept misalignment. We further
propose three classes of metrics for quantitatively assessing concept
alignment: hard accuracy, segmentation scores, and augmentation robustness. Our
analysis shows that probes with translation invariance and spatial alignment
consistently increase concept alignment. These findings highlight the need for
alignment-based evaluation metrics rather than probe accuracy, and the
importance of tailoring probes to both the model architecture and the nature of
the target concept.

Method: 设计了一个以可复现性、正确性和可扩展性为中心的工具箱，实现了12种对抗攻击算法，集成了7个涵盖危害性、过度拒绝和效用评估的基准数据集，并通过Hugging Face提供对多种开源LLM的访问。

Result: 框架包含用于比较和复现的高级功能，如计算资源跟踪、确定性结果和分布评估技术，并与JudgeZoo集成进行评判。

Conclusion: 这些组件共同为LLM安全领域的透明、可比较和可复现研究建立了坚实基础。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of research on Large Language Model (LLM) safety and
robustness has produced a fragmented and oftentimes buggy ecosystem of
implementations, datasets, and evaluation methods. This fragmentation makes
reproducibility and comparability across studies challenging, hindering
meaningful progress. To address these issues, we introduce AdversariaLLM, a
toolbox for conducting LLM jailbreak robustness research. Its design centers on
reproducibility, correctness, and extensibility. The framework implements
twelve adversarial attack algorithms, integrates seven benchmark datasets
spanning harmfulness, over-refusal, and utility evaluation, and provides access
to a wide range of open-weight LLMs via Hugging Face. The implementation
includes advanced features for comparability and reproducibility such as
compute-resource tracking, deterministic results, and distributional evaluation
techniques. \name also integrates judging through the companion package
JudgeZoo, which can also be used independently. Together, these components aim
to establish a robust foundation for transparent, comparable, and reproducible
research in LLM safety.

### [158] [RxSafeBench: Identifying Medication Safety Issues of Large Language Models in Simulated Consultation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04328)
*Jiahao Zhao,Luxin Xu,Minghuan Tan,Lichao Zhang,Ahmadreza Argha,Hamid Alinejad-Rokny,Min Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个评估大型语言模型药物安全性的框架RxSafeBench，包含6,725种禁忌症、28,781种药物相互作用和14,906个适应症-药物对，通过2,443个高质量临床咨询场景测试LLMs的药物推荐安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的医疗系统在药物安全性方面的研究有限，缺乏真实世界数据集，且在真实临床咨询环境下的评估不足。

Method: 构建模拟临床咨询的框架，生成包含药物风险的诊断对话，建立药物安全数据库RxRisk DB，采用两阶段过滤策略确保临床真实性和专业质量，使用结构化多选题评估LLMs的药物推荐安全性。

Result: 当前LLMs在整合禁忌症和药物相互作用知识方面存在困难，特别是当风险是隐含而非明确时表现不佳。

Conclusion: RxSafeBench提供了首个全面的LLM药物安全性评估基准，揭示了确保基于LLM系统药物安全性的关键挑战，为通过更好的提示和任务特定调优提高可靠性提供了见解。

Abstract: Numerous medical systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have
achieved remarkable progress in diverse healthcare tasks. However, research on
their medication safety remains limited due to the lack of real world datasets,
constrained by privacy and accessibility issues. Moreover, evaluation of LLMs
in realistic clinical consultation settings, particularly regarding medication
safety, is still underexplored. To address these gaps, we propose a framework
that simulates and evaluates clinical consultations to systematically assess
the medication safety capabilities of LLMs. Within this framework, we generate
inquiry diagnosis dialogues with embedded medication risks and construct a
dedicated medication safety database, RxRisk DB, containing 6,725
contraindications, 28,781 drug interactions, and 14,906 indication-drug pairs.
A two-stage filtering strategy ensures clinical realism and professional
quality, resulting in the benchmark RxSafeBench with 2,443 high-quality
consultation scenarios. We evaluate leading open-source and proprietary LLMs
using structured multiple choice questions that test their ability to recommend
safe medications under simulated patient contexts. Results show that current
LLMs struggle to integrate contraindication and interaction knowledge,
especially when risks are implied rather than explicit. Our findings highlight
key challenges in ensuring medication safety in LLM-based systems and provide
insights into improving reliability through better prompting and task-specific
tuning. RxSafeBench offers the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
medication safety in LLMs, advancing safer and more trustworthy AI-driven
clinical decision support.

### [159] [Monitor-Generate-Verify (MGV):Formalising Metacognitive Theory for Language Model Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04341)
*Nick Oh,Fernand Gobet*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了Monitor-Generate-Verify（MGV）框架，通过在Generate-Verify范式前添加显式监控机制来解决前缀主导陷阱问题，将元认知理论转化为计算规范。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的测试时推理架构缺乏监控过程，导致模型过早陷入次优推理路径而难以恢复，造成约20%的准确率损失。

Method: 将Flavell以及Nelson和Narens的元认知理论形式化为计算规范，在生成开始前添加显式监控机制，通过验证反馈来优化未来监控。

Result: 虽然未提供实证验证，但这是首次系统地将基础元认知理论转化为计算框架。

Conclusion: MGV框架为理解推理系统失败提供了原则性词汇，并为未来测试时推理设计提出了具体的架构干预建议。

Abstract: Test-time reasoning architectures such as those following the Generate-Verify
paradigm -- where a model iteratively refines or verifies its own generated
outputs -- prioritise generation and verification but exclude the monitoring
processes that determine when and how reasoning should begin. This omission may
contribute to the prefix dominance trap, in which models commit early to
suboptimal reasoning paths and seldom recover, yielding roughly 20% accuracy
loss. We address this architectural gap by formalising Flavell's and Nelson and
Narens' metacognitive theories into computational specifications, proposing the
Monitor-Generate-Verify (MGV) framework. MGV extends the Generate-Verify
paradigm by adding explicit monitoring that captures metacognitive experiences
(from difficulty assessments to confidence judgements) before generation begins
and refines future monitoring through verification feedback. Though we present
no empirical validation, this work provides the first systematic computational
translation of foundational metacognitive theories, offering a principled
vocabulary for understanding reasoning system failures and suggesting specific
architectural interventions for future test-time reasoning designs.

### [160] [The Peril of Preference: Why GRPO fails on Ordinal Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04439)
*Anisha Garg,Ganesh Venkatesh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CoRPO是一种新的强化学习算法，解决了GRPO在使用序数奖励时对失败轨迹给予正优势的问题，通过自适应基线确保失败解决方案不会被正强化，并在达到质量阈值后自动切换到相对偏好模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO的简单性使其在适应LLMs执行特定任务时很受欢迎，但这种简单性也使其在处理更丰富的非二元反馈时存在缺陷，特别是在使用序数奖励给予部分信用时，GRPO的组平均基线经常对失败轨迹分配正优势并强化错误行为。

Method: 提出了Correctness Relative Policy Optimization (CoRPO)，使用自适应基线强制执行最低质量阈值，确保失败的解决方案永远不会被正强化。一旦策略持续满足此阈值，基线会自动过渡到相对偏好模式，推动模型找到最优解决方案而不仅仅是"可接受"的解决方案。

Result: 在代码验证任务上进行了实证验证，CoRPO表现出更稳定的收敛性和更好的域外泛化能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作代表了使LLMs通过强化学习学习真正新能力的关键步骤，通过让LLMs从丰富的多维反馈中学习，从二元奖励进展到序数奖励，并进一步向更密集的每步监督发展。

Abstract: Group-relative Policy Optimization's (GRPO) simplicity makes it highly
desirable for adapting LLMs to become experts at specific tasks. But this
simplicity also makes it ill-specified as we seek to enhance RL training with
richer, non-binary feedback. When using ordinal rewards to give partial credit,
GRPO's simplicity starts to hurt, as its group-average baseline often assigns a
positive advantage to failed trajectories and reinforces incorrect behavior.
  We introduce Correctness Relative Policy Optimization (CoRPO), a new
formulation that solves this flaw. CoRPO uses an adaptive baseline that
enforces a minimum quality threshold, ensuring failed solutions are never
positively reinforced. Once the policy consistently meets this threshold, the
baseline automatically transitions to a relative preference mode, pushing the
model to find optimal solutions rather than just "acceptable" ones. We
empirically validate CoRPO on a code verification task, where it demonstrates
more stable convergence and better out-of-domain generalization.
  This work represents a critical step in our broader research program to
enable LLMs to learn genuinely new capabilities through reinforcement learning.
We achieve this by enabling LLMs to learn from rich, multi-dimensional feedback
- progressing from binary to ordinal rewards in this work, and onward to
denser, per-step supervision.

*Andrea Cera Palatsi,Samuel Martin-Gutierrez,Ana S. Cardenal,Max Pellert*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文开发了博弈论实验的数字孪生系统，通过系统化提示和探测框架评估LLMs的行为表现。研究发现Llama模型能高保真复制人类合作模式，而Qwen模型更接近纳什均衡预测，无需基于角色的提示即可实现群体行为复制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLMs与人类决策的相似性至关重要，因为不匹配可能导致实际应用中的有害结果，而无法复制人类行为则使LLMs在社会模拟中无效。

Method: 开发博弈论实验的数字孪生，引入系统化提示和探测框架进行机器行为评估，测试了Llama、Mistral和Qwen三个开源模型。

Result: Llama能高保真复制人类合作模式，捕捉人类偏离理性选择理论的行为；Qwen与纳什均衡预测紧密对齐；无需角色提示即可实现群体行为复制；能生成原始参数网格外新游戏配置的可测试假设。

Conclusion: 适当校准的LLMs能够复制聚合人类行为模式，并实现未探索实验空间的系统探索，为社会科学研究提供补充方法，生成关于人类社会决策的新实证预测。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used both to make decisions in
domains such as health, education and law, and to simulate human behavior. Yet
how closely LLMs mirror actual human decision-making remains poorly understood.
This gap is critical: misalignment could produce harmful outcomes in practical
applications, while failure to replicate human behavior renders LLMs
ineffective for social simulations. Here, we address this gap by developing a
digital twin of game-theoretic experiments and introducing a systematic
prompting and probing framework for machine-behavioral evaluation. Testing
three open-source models (Llama, Mistral and Qwen), we find that Llama
reproduces human cooperation patterns with high fidelity, capturing human
deviations from rational choice theory, while Qwen aligns closely with Nash
equilibrium predictions. Notably, we achieved population-level behavioral
replication without persona-based prompting, simplifying the simulation
process. Extending beyond the original human-tested games, we generate and
preregister testable hypotheses for novel game configurations outside the
original parameter grid. Our findings demonstrate that appropriately calibrated
LLMs can replicate aggregate human behavioral patterns and enable systematic
exploration of unexplored experimental spaces, offering a complementary
approach to traditional research in the social and behavioral sciences that
generates new empirical predictions about human social decision-making.

### [162] [Are We Asking the Right Questions? On Ambiguity in Natural Language Queries for Tabular Data Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04584)
*Daniel Gomm,Cornelius Wolff,Madelon Hulsebos*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出将自然语言查询中的歧义视为合作交互的特征而非缺陷，开发了一个区分可解析的合作查询与不可解析的非合作查询的理论框架，并分析了15个流行数据集中的查询类型分布问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将查询歧义视为缺陷，本文认为歧义是合作交互的特征，用户和系统应共同承担查询规范的责任，需要重新思考自然语言表格数据接口的设计和评估方法。

Method: 开发了一个理论框架来区分合作查询和非合作查询，并将该框架应用于15个流行的表格问答和分析数据集，分析其中的查询类型分布。

Result: 发现现有数据集中的查询类型混合不当，既不适合评估系统执行准确性，也不适合评估解释能力，需要重新设计评估方法。

Conclusion: 该框架将视角从消除歧义转向通过合作解决查询，为自然语言表格数据接口提供了更明智的设计和评估方向，并指出了未来研究的路径。

Abstract: Natural language interfaces to tabular data must handle ambiguities inherent
to queries. Instead of treating ambiguity as a deficiency, we reframe it as a
feature of cooperative interaction, where the responsibility of query
specification is shared among the user and the system. We develop a principled
framework distinguishing cooperative queries, i.e., queries that yield a
resolvable interpretation, from uncooperative queries that cannot be resolved.
Applying the framework to evaluations for tabular question answering and
analysis, we analyze the queries in 15 popular datasets, and observe an
uncontrolled mixing of query types neither adequate for evaluating a system's
execution accuracy nor for evaluating interpretation capabilities. Our
framework and analysis of queries shifts the perspective from fixing ambiguity
to embracing cooperation in resolving queries. This reflection enables more
informed design and evaluation for natural language interfaces for tabular
data, for which we outline implications and directions for future research.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于正当代表性（JR）概念的审核框架，用于衡量专家问答环节中问题选择的代表性水平，并开发了高效的审核算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在公民大会等审议过程中，参与者只能选择有限数量的问题向专家提问，如何确保这些问题能充分代表所有参与者的利益是一个重要挑战。

Method: 引入基于正当代表性（JR）的审核框架，开发了在通用效用设置下审核JR的算法，最有效算法的时间复杂度为O(mn log n)。将方法应用于历史审议数据，比较不同问题选择方式的代表性。

Result: 开发了高效的JR审核算法，应用于历史审议数据比较了主持人选择、整数线性规划选择和大型语言模型生成的问题的代表性。结果表明LLMs在支持审议过程中既有潜力也有当前局限性。

Conclusion: 通过将审核方法集成到已在50多个国家使用的在线审议平台中，使实践者能够轻松审核和改进未来审议中的代表性。

Abstract: A central feature of many deliberative processes, such as citizens'
assemblies and deliberative polls, is the opportunity for participants to
engage directly with experts. While participants are typically invited to
propose questions for expert panels, only a limited number can be selected due
to time constraints. This raises the challenge of how to choose a small set of
questions that best represent the interests of all participants. We introduce
an auditing framework for measuring the level of representation provided by a
slate of questions, based on the social choice concept known as justified
representation (JR). We present the first algorithms for auditing JR in the
general utility setting, with our most efficient algorithm achieving a runtime
of $O(mn\log n)$, where $n$ is the number of participants and $m$ is the number
of proposed questions. We apply our auditing methods to historical
deliberations, comparing the representativeness of (a) the actual questions
posed to the expert panel (chosen by a moderator), (b) participants' questions
chosen via integer linear programming, (c) summary questions generated by large
language models (LLMs). Our results highlight both the promise and current
limitations of LLMs in supporting deliberative processes. By integrating our
methods into an online deliberation platform that has been used for over
hundreds of deliberations across more than 50 countries, we make it easy for
practitioners to audit and improve representation in future deliberations.

*Narjes Nourzad,Hanqing Yang,Shiyu Chen,Carlee Joe-Wong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DR.WELL是一个去中心化的神经符号框架，用于合作多智能体规划，通过两阶段协商协议和符号规划实现高效协作，避免轨迹级别的脆弱对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决合作多智能体规划中由于部分信息和有限通信导致的轨迹级别协调失败问题，通过提升抽象层次来增强同步性和集体进展。

Method: 采用两阶段协商协议：智能体首先提出候选角色及推理，然后在共识和环境约束下承诺联合分配；随后每个智能体独立生成和执行符号计划，通过共享世界模型进行执行结果接地。

Result: 在合作推块任务实验中，智能体能够跨情景适应，动态世界模型捕获可重用模式，提高了任务完成率和效率，但需要时间开销来发展更高效的协作策略。

Conclusion: 通过符号规划而非原始轨迹推理，DR.WELL避免了脆弱的步骤级对齐，实现了可重用、可同步和可解释的高层操作，提升了多智能体协作的效率和适应性。

Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent planning requires agents to make joint decisions with
partial information and limited communication. Coordination at the trajectory
level often fails, as small deviations in timing or movement cascade into
conflicts. Symbolic planning mitigates this challenge by raising the level of
abstraction and providing a minimal vocabulary of actions that enable
synchronization and collective progress. We present DR. WELL, a decentralized
neurosymbolic framework for cooperative multi-agent planning. Cooperation
unfolds through a two-phase negotiation protocol: agents first propose
candidate roles with reasoning and then commit to a joint allocation under
consensus and environment constraints. After commitment, each agent
independently generates and executes a symbolic plan for its role without
revealing detailed trajectories. Plans are grounded in execution outcomes via a
shared world model that encodes the current state and is updated as agents act.
By reasoning over symbolic plans rather than raw trajectories, DR. WELL avoids
brittle step-level alignment and enables higher-level operations that are
reusable, synchronizable, and interpretable. Experiments on cooperative
block-push tasks show that agents adapt across episodes, with the dynamic world
model capturing reusable patterns and improving task completion rates and
efficiency. Experiments on cooperative block-push tasks show that our dynamic
world model improves task completion and efficiency through negotiation and
self-refinement, trading a time overhead for evolving, more efficient
collaboration strategies.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VeriCoT是一种神经符号方法，通过将思维链推理步骤形式化为一阶逻辑，并利用自动求解器验证逻辑有效性，从而识别和纠正LLMs推理中的缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs虽然能通过思维链进行多步推理，但无法可靠验证自身逻辑，即使在得出正确答案时底层推理也可能存在缺陷，这在高风险场景中削弱了可信度。

Method: VeriCoT从思维链推理中提取形式化逻辑论证，将每个推理步骤形式化为一阶逻辑，识别基于源上下文、常识知识或先前推理步骤的前提，利用符号表示实现自动验证。

Result: 在ProofWriter、LegalBench和BioASQ数据集上的实验表明，VeriCoT能有效识别有缺陷的推理，并作为最终答案正确性的强预测指标。通过验证信号实现推理时自我反思、监督微调和偏好微调，进一步提高了推理有效性和准确性。

Conclusion: VeriCoT通过将神经语言模型与符号推理相结合，提供了一种可验证的推理框架，增强了LLMs推理的可信度和可靠性，特别是在高风险应用场景中。

Abstract: LLMs can perform multi-step reasoning through Chain-of-Thought (CoT), but
they cannot reliably verify their own logic. Even when they reach correct
answers, the underlying reasoning may be flawed, undermining trust in
high-stakes scenarios. To mitigate this issue, we introduce VeriCoT, a
neuro-symbolic method that extracts and verifies formal logical arguments from
CoT reasoning. VeriCoT formalizes each CoT reasoning step into first-order
logic and identifies premises that ground the argument in source context,
commonsense knowledge, or prior reasoning steps. The symbolic representation
enables automated solvers to verify logical validity while the NL premises
allow humans and systems to identify ungrounded or fallacious reasoning steps.
Experiments on the ProofWriter, LegalBench, and BioASQ datasets show VeriCoT
effectively identifies flawed reasoning, and serves as a strong predictor of
final answer correctness. We also leverage VeriCoT's verification signal for
(1) inference-time self-reflection, (2) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on
VeriCoT-distilled datasets and (3) preference fine-tuning (PFT) with direct
preference optimization (DPO) using verification-based pairwise rewards,
further improving reasoning validity and accuracy.

*Xiaolu Chen,Yong Liao*

TL;DR: 本文提出了Caption Injection，这是首个多模态G-SEO方法，通过从图像中提取标题并注入文本内容来增强生成式搜索引擎中的内容可见性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的G-SEO方法仅限于基于文本的优化，无法充分利用多模态数据。随着多模态检索增强生成技术的发展，需要开发能够整合视觉语义的多模态优化方法。

Method: 提出Caption Injection方法，从图像中提取标题并将其注入文本内容中，将视觉语义整合到文本中，以增强生成式搜索场景中的内容主观可见性。

Result: 在MRAMG基准测试中，Caption Injection在G-Eval指标下显著优于仅文本的G-SEO基线方法，证明了多模态整合在G-SEO中的必要性和有效性。

Conclusion: 多模态整合对于提高用户感知的内容可见性至关重要，Caption Injection方法为生成式搜索优化开辟了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Generative Search Engines (GSEs) leverage Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) techniques and Large Language Models (LLMs) to integrate multi-source
information and provide users with accurate and comprehensive responses. Unlike
traditional search engines that present results in ranked lists, GSEs shift
users' attention from sequential browsing to content-driven subjective
perception, driving a paradigm shift in information retrieval. In this context,
enhancing the subjective visibility of content through Generative Search Engine
Optimization (G-SEO) methods has emerged as a new research focus. With the
rapid advancement of Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG)
techniques, GSEs can now efficiently integrate text, images, audio, and video,
producing richer responses that better satisfy complex information needs.
Existing G-SEO methods, however, remain limited to text-based optimization and
fail to fully exploit multimodal data. To address this gap, we propose Caption
Injection, the first multimodal G-SEO approach, which extracts captions from
images and injects them into textual content, integrating visual semantics to
enhance the subjective visibility of content in generative search scenarios. We
systematically evaluate Caption Injection on MRAMG, a benchmark for MRAG, under
both unimodal and multimodal settings. Experimental results show that Caption
Injection significantly outperforms text-only G-SEO baselines under the G-Eval
metric, demonstrating the necessity and effectiveness of multimodal integration
in G-SEO to improve user-perceived content visibility.

TL;DR: 本文提出E-CARE方法，通过构建常识推理因子图来高效利用LLMs的常识推理能力，在电商推荐任务中仅需单次LLM前向传播即可实现推理，相比现有方法显著降低成本并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLMs的电商推荐方法存在实时推理成本高、需要人工标注和微调等问题，需要一种更高效的方式来利用LLMs的常识推理能力。

Method: 提出E-CARE框架，构建常识推理因子图来编码LLMs的推理模式，在推理时仅需单次LLM前向传播即可访问常识推理能力。

Result: 在两个下游任务上的实验显示，精度@5指标提升了最高12.1%。

Conclusion: E-CARE方法能够高效利用LLMs的常识推理能力，显著降低推理成本的同时提升推荐性能。

Abstract: Finding relevant products given a user query plays a pivotal role in an
e-commerce platform, as it can spark shopping behaviors and result in revenue
gains. The challenge lies in accurately predicting the correlation between
queries and products. Recently, mining the cross-features between queries and
products based on the commonsense reasoning capacity of Large Language Models
(LLMs) has shown promising performance. However, such methods suffer from high
costs due to intensive real-time LLM inference during serving, as well as human
annotations and potential Supervised Fine Tuning (SFT). To boost efficiency
while leveraging the commonsense reasoning capacity of LLMs for various
e-commerce tasks, we propose the Efficient Commonsense-Augmented Recommendation
Enhancer (E-CARE). During inference, models augmented with E-CARE can access
commonsense reasoning with only a single LLM forward pass per query by
utilizing a commonsense reasoning factor graph that encodes most of the
reasoning schema from powerful LLMs. The experiments on 2 downstream tasks show
an improvement of up to 12.1% on precision@5.

Motivation: 大学生在本科阶段面临巨大挑战，缺乏个性化的按需指导，现有数字工具无法提供规模化定制化辅导。

Method: 构建数据摄取管道处理CSV文件和大学网页等多样化信息源，采用BM25词汇排名与ChromaDB语义检索的混合检索方法，使用LLaMA-3.3-70B大语言模型生成对话响应。

Result: 生成文本语义相关性高，BERTScore为0.831，METEOR分数为0.809；数据管道效率良好，更新数据耗时106.82秒，新数据处理耗时368.62秒。

Conclusion: 该聊天机器人能够帮助学生解答疑问，更好地理解大学生活，并协助他们在开放学分制大学中规划更好的学期安排。

Abstract: University students face immense challenges during their undergraduate lives,
often being deprived of personalized on-demand guidance that mentors fail to
provide at scale. Digital tools exist, but there is a serious lack of
customized coaching for newcomers. This paper presents an AI-powered chatbot
that will serve as a mentor for the students of BRAC University. The main
component is a data ingestion pipeline that efficiently processes and updates
information from diverse sources, such as CSV files and university webpages.
The chatbot retrieves information through a hybrid approach, combining BM25
lexical ranking with ChromaDB semantic retrieval, and uses a Large Language
Model, LLaMA-3.3-70B, to generate conversational responses. The generated text
was found to be semantically highly relevant, with a BERTScore of 0.831 and a
METEOR score of 0.809. The data pipeline was also very efficient, taking 106.82
seconds for updates, compared to 368.62 seconds for new data. This chatbot will
be able to help students by responding to their queries, helping them to get a
better understanding of university life, and assisting them to plan better
routines for their semester in the open-credit university.

*Carl Kugblenu,Petri Vuorimaa*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出一种无协调的通道分区方法，将向量搜索系统中的重复计算转化为互补工作，在不增加成本或延长截止时间的情况下提高搜索覆盖率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生产向量搜索系统通常通过并行通道（线程、副本或分片）来满足延迟SLO，但这些通道经常重新发现相同的候选结果，导致额外计算无法增加覆盖范围。

Method: 为每个查询：(1)构建确定性的候选池，大小等于总top-k预算；(2)应用每个查询的伪随机排列；(3)为每个通道分配不相交的位置切片。通道在构造时返回不同结果，无需运行时协调。

Result: 在4个通道、总候选预算64的情况下，SIFT1M数据集上recall@10从0.249提升到0.999，通道重叠从近100%降至0%；MS MARCO数据集上hit@10从0.200提升到0.601，MRR@10从0.133提升到0.330。

Conclusion: 提出简单操作指南：将每个查询池大小设为总预算，确定性地跨通道分区位置，在不改变预算或截止时间的情况下将冗余扇出转化为互补覆盖。

Abstract: Production vector search systems often fan out each query across parallel
lanes (threads, replicas, or shards) to meet latency service-level objectives
(SLOs). In practice, these lanes rediscover the same candidates, so extra
compute does not increase coverage. We present a coordination-free lane
partitioner that turns duplication into complementary work at the same cost and
deadline. For each query we (1) build a deterministic candidate pool sized to
the total top-k budget, (2) apply a per-query pseudorandom permutation, and (3)
assign each lane a disjoint slice of positions. Lanes then return different
results by construction, with no runtime coordination.
  At equal cost with four lanes (total candidate budget 64), on SIFT1M (1M SIFT
feature vectors) with Hierarchical Navigable Small World graphs (HNSW)
recall@10 rises from 0.249 to 0.999 while lane overlap falls from nearly 100%
to 0%. On MS MARCO (8.8M passages) with HNSW, hit@10 improves from 0.200 to
0.601 and Mean Reciprocal Rank at 10 (MRR@10) from 0.133 to 0.330. For inverted
file (IVF) indexes we see smaller but consistent gains (for example, +11% on MS
MARCO) by de-duplicating list routing. A microbenchmark shows planner overhead
of ~37 microseconds per query (mean at the main setting) with linear growth in
the number of merged candidates.
  These results yield a simple operational guideline: size the per-query pool
to the total budget, deterministically partition positions across lanes, and
turn redundant fan-out into complementary coverage without changing budget or
deadline.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统协同过滤算法因用户-物品交互矩阵中的噪声导致推荐性能不佳，现有去噪方法多在单图上进行，会削弱路径依赖的协作信息。

Method: DRCSD包含协作信号解耦模块（按结构特征分解信号为不同阶次）和按阶去噪模块（对每个阶次进行针对性去噪），并改进传统GNN聚合机制以避免跨阶信号干扰。

Result: 在三个公开真实数据集上的实验表明，DRCSD对不稳定交互具有优越的鲁棒性，在推荐准确性指标上相比最先进基线模型获得统计显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: DRCSD通过协作信号解耦和按阶去噪策略，有效解决了传统去噪方法削弱协作信号的问题，显著提升了推荐系统的性能。

Abstract: Although the collaborative filtering (CF) algorithm has achieved remarkable
performance in recommendation systems, it suffers from suboptimal
recommendation performance due to noise in the user-item interaction matrix.
Numerous noise-removal studies have improved recommendation models, but most
existing approaches conduct denoising on a single graph. This may cause
attenuation of collaborative signals: removing edges between two nodes can
interrupt paths between other nodes, weakening path-dependent collaborative
information. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel
GNN-based CF model called DRCSD for denoising unstable interactions. DRCSD
includes two core modules: a collaborative signal decoupling module (decomposes
signals into distinct orders by structural characteristics) and an order-wise
denoising module (performs targeted denoising on each order). Additionally, the
information aggregation mechanism of traditional GNN-based CF models is
modified to avoid cross-order signal interference until the final pooling
operation. Extensive experiments on three public real-world datasets show that
DRCSD has superior robustness against unstable interactions and achieves
statistically significant performance improvements in recommendation accuracy
metrics compared to state-of-the-art baseline models.

Abstract: Modeling user preferences across domains remains a key challenge in slate
recommendation (i.e. recommending an ordered sequence of items) research. We
investigate how Large Language Models (LLM) can effectively act as world models
of user preferences through pairwise reasoning over slates. We conduct an
empirical study involving several LLMs on three tasks spanning different
datasets. Our results reveal relationships between task performance and
properties of the preference function captured by LLMs, hinting towards areas
for improvement and highlighting the potential of LLMs as world models in
recommender systems.

Conclusion: 通过更优的数学工具，建立了树独立数和诱导匹配树宽之间的多项式关系，为相关图类的研究提供了更好的理论保证。

Abstract: We study two graph parameters defined via tree decompositions:
tree-independence number and induced matching treewidth. Both parameters are
defined similarly as treewidth, but with respect to different measures of a
tree decomposition $\mathcal{T}$ of a graph $G$: for tree-independence number,
the measure is the maximum size of an independent set in $G$ included in some
bag of $\mathcal{T}$, while for the induced matching treewidth, the measure is
the maximum size of an induced matching in $G$ such that some bag of
$\mathcal{T}$ contains at least one endpoint of every edge of the matching.
  While the induced matching treewidth of any graph is bounded from above by
its tree-independence number, the family of complete bipartite graphs shows
that small induced matching treewidth does not imply small tree-independence
number. On the other hand, Abrishami, Bria\'nski, Czy\.zewska, McCarty,
Milani\v{c}, Rz\k{a}\.zewski, and Walczak~[SIAM Journal on Discrete
Mathematics, 2025] showed that, if a fixed biclique $K_{t,t}$ is excluded as an
induced subgraph, then the tree-independence number is bounded from above by
some function of the induced matching treewidth. The function resulting from
their proof is exponential even for fixed $t$, as it relies on multiple
applications of Ramsey's theorem. In this note we show, using the
K\"ov\'ari-S\'os-Tur\'an theorem, that for any class of $K_{t,t}$-free graphs,
the two parameters are in fact polynomially related.
